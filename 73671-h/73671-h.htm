<p>In laying this new edition of “Camping and
Camp-Cooking” before the reading public, it becomes
my duty—the most pleasant that falls
to the lot of a writer—to express my thanks
for the kind reception of the little book. That
it has been a success is proven by the kind words
of practical people. Hence, but little change has
been made in the body of the book; but an appendix
has been added on the care of the health,
the reason for which will be found therein expressed.</p>

</div>


<p>Vacation time brings to many the desire for
out-door life, as a refreshment for mind and body.
There seems to be a strain of wild blood in the
most of us, that impels us to leave the haunts
of man, occasionally, and getting out into the
wildwood, to live close to nature for awhile.
The expense of summer hotels and camps deters
many, and the cost of hiring professional guides
for those who wish to get rid of the formalities
of such resorts and do not know how to care
for themselves, prevents others.</p>

<p>There are many who like to leave their work
for a few weeks and go to the woods or lakeside.
They have neither the time nor the inclination
to adopt the life of the professional
trapper who lives by the chase and sleeps on the
soft side of a slab. They want rest; they wish
for pleasure; they require three square meals a
day, and they want the food well cooked, not
too full of ashes, and not too different from that
to which they have been accustomed for the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">(10)</span>
forty-nine or fifty weeks of the year. To this
class, the business man, the clerk, the mechanic,
to every one who wishes to camp out and does
not know how to do it and still keep his self-respect,
this book is addressed.</p>

<p>It is the result of an experience of over twenty
years, during which the writer has spent many
months in the woods, and fitted out many other
parties for their summer vacations. Over the
camp fire, while discussing methods with other
campers, or instructing the learner “how to do
it,” he has been asked many times to put his ideas
into shape for publication. Here they are, and
it is his hope that everyone who takes this little
book with him to camp, may enjoy himself to
the limit.</p>

<span class="title">CAMP OUTFITS</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p>A camping outfit should be light and compact
with all unnecessary articles eliminated and all
needful ones included. That reads a little funny,
but it is the gist of the whole question and the
biggest question that was ever presented to a
man. That is, you will think so when you are
trying to get a 100-pound outfit over a swampy
carry on a rainy day and while laying up over
a spell of wet weather afterward. In the first
place, you wonder why you brought so much
truck, and in the second place, why you did not
bring many other things. So it seems needless
to say that the composition of an outfit depends,
to some extent, on the individual taste of the
camper, and more upon the character of the trip.</p>

<p>No sane man would carry the same amount of
“duffle” on a walking trip that he would if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">(12)</span>
went with a team, or if he was to be in a permanent
camp during the whole of his trip.
Hence, I propose to classify them into two sorts—walking
trips and permanent camps. But before
I set down the list of <i lang="la">impedimenta</i> I want
to moralize a little.</p>

<p>I confess that I enjoy the comforts of life, and
as many of the luxuries as my purse or circumstances
will allow; and while I have enjoyed
many tramps with nothing but what I could easily
carry in my knapsack, I enjoy one much
better if I have more conveniences, and very few
vacationists care to “rough it” too much in the
short time they have for their annual trips, and
there is no need to do so.</p>

<p>One of the finest woodsmen and grandest of
men, “Nessmuk,” has written a book which is a
criterion for the man who can stand that kind of
trip; but what sort of a vacation do you suppose
a city clerk would have if he patterned his trip
after this model? The question was not needed;
he simply would not try it; for the average city
clerk is not so big a fool as he appears to the
average country dweller. So let it go at
that. To get back on our trail again. A party
would not need the same outfit in July that he
would require in October—and while there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">(13)</span>
no sense in sleeping cold at night because of a
lack of blankets, there is also no use for a sleeping-bag
for a July camping trip, and in this
judgment of the actual necessities is where the
average camper fails.</p>

<p>The majority of camping parties occur in the
warm season when game birds and animals are
protected by law, and there is no need for a gun,
but most men will confess to a feeling of greater
security when there is a firearm in camp. A
light revolver will serve all purposes to drive
away marauding animals or to while away a dull
hour at target practice, and a little practice will
render it thus available.</p>

<p>In the fall of the year the fishrod will be replaced
by the shotgun and rifle, but it is always
well to have a line and a few hooks in the ditty
bag. A few fish will make an acceptable change
in the diet, even if a deer hangs at the tent door.</p>

<p>The following lists have been compiled from
the experience of many years in fitting out parties
for the woods and are intended to cover everything
that is needed and with the idea that the
man who reads them knows but little about the
subject and wants to know all about it; and as
parties will vary in number of persons composing
it, I have individualized the items.</p>

</ul>

<p>In regard to the cooking apparatus much can
be said. There is a golden mean between bare
necessity and absolute convenience, that must be
estimated by the character of the trip. When
walking, with the lightest possible amount of
“duffle,” a tin plate may be used to cook everything
that cannot be spitted or baked in the
ashes. For a camp kettle on a walking trip I use a
common tin pail with riveted ears to hold the bail.
Do not let the water boil out of it while on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">(17)</span>
fire. Throw it away when you get to the end
of the trip. In permanent camp this is replaced
by a “graniteware” kettle, which forms the vehicle
for many a savory stew and chowder, besides
the more plebeian potato and onion. I prefer
this form of kettle, even if it be a little cumbersome,
for if the water boils away, as it
sometimes will in spite of all precautions, you
will not be left with a bottomless dish.</p>

<p>The coffee can may also be a tin pail, but in
whatsoever form it may be, see that it is so made
that it can be hung over the fire. Eschew all
patent contrivances for making coffee; they are
a delusion and a snare for the feet of the unwary,
and utterly unnecessary. The tight can
for condensed milk is a necessary thing when
moving about; to prevent waste a screw top is
best.</p>

<p>The fry pan is an important part of the outfit,
but not the most important. In it may be
cooked the entire food for the party—meat, fish,
bread and even the coffee. But look out that
it is of a convenient pattern for transportation.
Get a ten-inch thin iron pan, with a socket on
one side for a temporary handle, or have the handle
entirely removed, and fit it with a portable
handle to screw to the side. This detachable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">(18)</span>
handle may be used to lift any dish from the fire.</p>

<p>But because you have a pet fry pan, with automatic
accessories, do not become a slave to it.
Use the broiler on all possible occasions. The
stomach of the camper will stand many severe
strains, but it will finally rebel if treated to too
much grease. Use as little of this lubricant as
possible, and you will be surprised at the small
quantity needed.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Fry pan</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The remainder of the kit, with the exception
of the baker, needs no special comment; and of
that piece of apparatus, I have long been in
doubt whether it was a desirable article for the
camping outfit.</p>

<p>Personally, I never use the baker, as I prefer
to bake my bread in the fry pan, and my fish I
roll in wet paper or leaves and bake in the ashes.
With a desire to advise those who disagree with
me, I wish to say that I was with a party who
used an oven which accompanied a cooking outfit,
and it worked nicely. In fact, the whole apparatus
was without reproach, and was evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">(19)</span>
the result of practical experience. If I
could afford it, and had the room for its transportation,
I should use one just like it, when I
had a large party to provide for, as it saved time
and some trouble; but it was no better than the
more primitive method of the “bean hole,”
which will be discussed later.</p>

<p>A rubber blanket of some description is very
necessary, and I prefer the poncho with a slit
in the middle to enable it to be put over the
shoulders in case of rain as well as to lay beneath
the blankets while sleeping, to keep off the
dampness of the earth. If this pattern cannot
be obtained have two eyeletted holes made in
one edge of a rubber sheet, far enough apart <span class="cor" title="Source: so so" id="cor19">so</span>
that it may be looped around the neck. The
ordinary blanket may be of any character that
is desired. I use a light wool blanket together
with a light cotton blanket, both double and uncut,
for summer use, and a regulation sleeping
bag for cooler weather. The latter may be made
of oiled duck lined with the summer blankets,
or with one or more quilted puffs made of calico
and cotton batting.</p>

<p>The cloth bag—size of a pillow case—is a
very convenient article to be filled with leaves or
fir spills; this, however, is not indispensable, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">(20)</span>
a good pillow may be extemporized of a pair of
shoes with a person’s outer clothing laid over
them. The small cloth bags will be found convenient
in packing remnants of food, sugar, coffee,
<abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, which is so easily scattered by the ordinary
paper packages becoming broken.</p>

<p>Now a word in regard to clothes. Eschew
caps, helmets and straw hats, and wear a soft
felt hat, the softer the better; it will stand rain,
will not get broken, will keep the sun out of the
eyes and can be used for a multitude of purposes
from acting as holder for a hot pan or
kettle to stopping a hole in a stoven boat. Canvas
clothes are a delusion; they make a lot of
noise in the brush and are uncomfortable when
wet. Wear a suit of old woolen clothes with a
light flannel shirt; no vest is needed. These
garments are comfortable and warm, even when
damp, and are easily dried. Look out for your
feet; wear good, solid leather boots, and change
your socks every night, washing out and drying
each night the pair worn during the day. This
little attention to the comfort will prevent sore
feet on a long tramp. The remainder of the articles
seem to explain themselves. Never wear
new boots.</p>

<h4>FOOD.</h4>

<p>There now remains the question of food, and
it is the most difficult of all to handle, since there
is such a diversity of taste. I have endeavored
to apportion the ration to a healthy man’s appetite
and have considered that there will be more
or less fish, game, berries, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, gathered by the
party. If there is no one who can cook, of
course food must be procured already prepared.
But it seems very improbable that some of the
party will not take sufficient interest in this most
important requisite of camping to secure information
from his feminine relatives or friends,
and practice sufficient to enable him to make a
good cup of coffee, a respectable <span class="cor" title="Source: flap-jack" id="cor21">flapjack</span> and to
fry a pan of fish. With the materials set down
in the list, with what fish, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, will be brought
in, an ordinary camp cook will, in a permanent
camp, supply a different menu nearly every day
in the week. For instance, a party of three
would be provided with 18 pounds of meat for
ten days; this would include 3 pounds ham, 4
pounds bacon, 5 pounds salt pork and 6 pounds
corned beef. The pork would be used in baking
beans and frying fish, and the others for
broiling and hashes, while <span class="cor" title="Source: flap-jacks" id="cor21b">flapjacks</span>, johnny-cakes,
pan-cakes, rice and fruit puddings could
be concocted from the list.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="title">CAMP SHELTER</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p>One of the foremost considerations which confronts
the camper is shelter; for upon it depends,
to a large extent, his health and comfort. Of
course, the character of this shelter depends upon
many things: individual preference, location of
the camp and facilities for transportation. But
the first consideration is a tight roof and protection
from cold winds.</p>

<p>He is a poor woodsman, indeed, who in a
forest cannot provide himself with protection
from the weather. But every man who wishes
to camp is not a woodsman, and is the man
who is looking for advice. Woods frequenters
sleep many nights with nothing but the blue canopy
of heaven for a roof, and men have camped
for weeks with only a square of canvas for a
“dog tent.” But although I have tried both
plans and thoroughly enjoyed myself, I must
confess that I hanker for a good wall or
shanty tent when the winds blow cold or the rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">(23)</span>
falls wet, and these things we must always expect.</p>


<h4>THE WALL TENT.</h4>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_023_small" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_023.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_023_small.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption class="caption">Wall tent</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If camp is located where transportation by
team or water is available, when the temperature
is above freezing, carry a wall tent, with a fly.
It admits of better ventilation than an A tent,
gives more head room for the sleeper and weighs
but a trifle more. By all means do not omit the
fly. Without this, in a driving rain, the water
will beat through in a fine spray and dampen
everything inside. Moreover, it is almost impossible
to avoid hitting the canvas, sometimes,
and the result is that whenever the wet cloth is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">(24)</span>
touched from the inside it will start a leak unless
the canvas is very thoroughly waterproofed.</p>

<p>In pitching a tent, select a suitable site, on
top of a little knoll if possible, with the ground
as level as may be. Do not under any circumstances
pitch it in a hollow or gully where the
water will run in. Clear off the brush, remove
all bunches from the ground and carefully pitch
the tent. See that all is clear before raising and
that the guys hang evenly and run smoothly.</p>

<p>Next, dig a trench about six inches deep all
around the outside, and about six inches from
the canvas. Be sure not to neglect this precaution
or you may awake in a puddle of water,
which is not conducive to a happy frame of
mind. Also remember that dampness will contract
the cloth and ropes; so before you go to
bed, slacken the guys a little or, if it rains in
the night, you may awake with a tent pin flapping
about your ears, the cloth torn or the tent
blown down.</p>


<h4>SHANTY TENT.</h4>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_025_small" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_025.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_025_small.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption class="caption">Shanty tent</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If there are only one or two in the party, and
especially if weight is a consideration, a “shanty
tent” is desirable. One which I have just completed
is 6 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> high in front and 2 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> high in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">(25)</span>
back, 7 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> long, 6 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> wide, with fly. No poles
are needed if there are trees, for the head rope
which goes across the front at the top is stretched
between two trees and the tent guyed from that.
The front of the tent may be lifted for an awning,
when not needed to close the tent, by supporting
the canvas on poles. With this tent
there is sufficient length for a tall man, width
enough for two to sleep comfortably and room
enough to stow the “duffle,” while there is sufficient
head room at the rear to afford good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">(26)</span>
ventilation for a small party. I prefer this pattern
of tent to all others for the reason that there
is less lost space in ratio to the weight, with more
convenience, than in any other style known to
me.</p>


<h4>THE DOG TENT.</h4>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_026_small" style="max-width: 74.125em;">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_026.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_026.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption class="caption">Dog tent</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, so far as a substitute for a comfortable
tent is concerned, there is a wide range for
choice. When traveling rapidly on foot, with as
little <i lang="la">impedimenta</i> as possible, a simple square
canvas, furnished with loops at two sides and
large enough to shelter a man, will amply suffice.
When the time arrives to make camp a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">(27)</span>
pole is lashed across two trees or supported on
crotched sticks, the canvas is thrown across it
and pinned down by the side loops and the camp
is ready. If you wish to shut up one end cut
some evergreen boughs and stick them thickly in
the ground at that end; this will break the wind.
Build your camp fire in front of the opened end
and you will be comfortable.</p>


<h4>THE LEAN-TO.</h4>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_027_small" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_027.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_027_small.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption class="caption">A Lean-to</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you desire to travel lighter still, or are
caught in the woods without shelter, a few minutes’
work will suffice to build a “lean-to.” To
erect this structure find two trees about four to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">(28)</span>
six feet apart, or drive two poles into the ground.
Lash another pole across them about five feet
from the ground for a ridge pole. Cut five poles
about eight feet long and lay across this, with
one end resting on the ground to form the roof.
Cover these poles with bark, laid shingle fashion,
or with a thick layer of evergreen boughs.
It is astonishing how heavy a rain a bough roof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">(29)</span>
will shed if properly laid on. Now stick some
poles at the two sides, with the tops lashed to
the side roof poles, wattle in some brush and
you have a camp that will keep you dry and
with a good fire in front will be as warm as a log
house, for the heat of the fire is all reflected down
by the slanting roof.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_028_small" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_028.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_028.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption class="caption">Another Lean-to</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you have no time for so elaborate a construction,
cut a pole, rest one end in the crotch
of a tree, the other on the ground. With this
for a ridge pole lean up poles and brush on each
side till you have room for your shelter. If you
have no axe to cut a pole, find a leaning tree or
a fallen log, or even a boulder, and pile brush
against it, having first thrown down a lot of
boughs for a bed. This sort of a structure is
capable of infinite variation.</p>


<h4>THE LOG HUT.</h4>

<p>Sometimes in cold weather it becomes necessary
to have some shelter more substantial than
a tent or even a bark shanty, especially when a
prolonged stay is to be made at some central
place. A log hut will provide for this, and when
timber is plenty can be made with no other tools
than a narrow axe. Do not be too extravagant
in your idea of size. A small building is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">(30)</span>
easily kept warm than a large one and a house
8 × 10 feet will shelter four men.</p>

<p>Cut straight logs about 8 inches in diameter.
Nine logs 11 feet long for the back; three logs
11 feet long, and sixteen logs 4 feet long for the
front; eighteen logs 9 feet long for the ends.</p>

<p>Clear a level place free from brush and lay two
11-foot and two 9-foot logs on the ground in
the form of a square, with the ends of the logs
notched to hold them in place, with notches deep
enough so that the next log when similarly
fitted will lie snugly on top. Now proceed to
pile the logs up like a cob-house, notching each
log at the corners and using the long logs for
the back and two of the short logs for the front
to provide for a door in the center, where the
ends of the logs should be held by a pole on
each side. When the short logs are used up put
on the long ones. The logs of the front and
back should be laid with the butt and top alternated
to keep them level, but the ends of the
camp should have the butts all laid toward the
front to form the pitch of the roof and those
with the greatest taper should be selected for the
ends.</p>

<p>For the roof, cut poles 13 feet long, lay them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">(31)</span>
lengthwise and notch them into the top logs
of the ends. Then cover with birch or hemlock
bark. Lay poles across to prevent the high
winds from displacing it and throw on evergreen
boughs to break the force of the rain.</p>

<p>If it be desired to have a pitch roof cut short
logs to fill in the gable ends and hew down the
pitch to the desired angle. Fill all crevices with
moss, grass or clay. A door may be made of
slabs split from a cedar tree and hung on leather
or rawhide hinges.</p>

<p>For fittings build two bunks of poles across
the narrow end and fill them with fir browse.
There will be room enough to stow personal belongings
at the foot of the bunks and they will
add to the warmth. If a camp stove is used
place it at the back opposite the door and run
the pipe through the roof. If no stove is used,
make a fireplace of rocks laid up in clay and
have a hole in the roof for the smoke to go out.
If dry wood is used the smoke in the room is
not offensive, for a very little fire will warm
the place as much as is desirable. Do not use
cedar wood for the fire, for the sparks will fly
all over the place.</p>

<p>If desirable, many elaborations of this building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">(32)</span>
can be made. If a chimney is desired build
it of stones and clay and build the wall into it,
so as to leave the chimney half inside and half
outside.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">(33)</span></p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="title">GENERAL ADVICE</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p>In preparing for camp, one of the most important
questions to be settled is the choice of
companions. Nowhere will human nature be
developed as in the camp, where quarters are limited
and when there is no opportunity to get out
of the way and stamp down “that ugly feeling”
that the best of us have at times. If there is a
single bristle on a man’s back it will rise on an
uncomfortable rainy day in camp. If a man is
a gentleman he keeps his coat on and it bothers
no one but his own conscience; but a surly grumbler,
a gourmand who <em>must</em> have just what he
wants to eat, irrespective of how much trouble
it may make, or a selfish, lazy man, will disturb
the feelings of all the rest.</p>

<p>And a word of advice here. Constitute one
man, the best-posted and most equal-tempered
man in the party, as captain; and when a man
makes himself obnoxious and will not be reasoned
with, let the captain call assistance, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">(34)</span>
necessary, and either cool him off in the nearest
lake or quietly escort him to the nearest point
of embarkation and bid him a long farewell;
at all events, remember next year that he is not
eligible for membership.</p>

<p>Make the party small (four is enough, three
is better), for many reasons. There is less
chance for argument, crowding is avoided, and
transportation facilitated. If the party is necessarily
larger, divide it up into squads, so that the
man in charge of the party may not have all
his own fun spoiled in attending to the needs
of others. Make one man paymaster and do
not ask him to shoulder the whole expense of
the trip, but make an estimate of the cost and
hand over your share in advance. Then when
the trip is over, cheerfully settle up, and if you
are not wholly satisfied, do not put up a kick,
but swallow the dose and remember it the next
time.</p>

<p>More than that, always remember that life is
too short to grumble or fight, and if any campmate
makes himself too obnoxious, get rid of
him, or manage to get a letter calling you home
on important business. You go to camp to get
needed rest and escape the fights of a busy life,
and no man has a right to interfere with another’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">(35)</span>
pleasure; always provided that the other
party behaves like a man himself.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose that you have procured
your outfits, selected your camp ground, and
have arrived at the place. Set to work quickly
to select a site for the tent, and get it ready
for occupancy at once. All hands take hold
under the direction of your captain, and the
work will all be over in a short time. Pitch the
tent and get your beds ready; make a fireplace
and get wood for a fire, so the cook will be able
to tend strictly to his cooking. If Joe or Tom
grabs his rod the moment it is taken from the
conveyance, unless he is so ordered by the captain,
just insert your fingers under his coat collar
and politely kick a little sense into him.</p>

<p>When you get your first meals do not give
way to the abnormal appetite always generated
by fresh air and exercise, but eat moderately until
you get accustomed to the changed conditions,
and thus avoid a multitude of ills. It is disgusting
to a sensible man to see a campmate gorge
himself and then wake everyone in the small
hours of the night groaning with colic. A sick
man in camp is a nuisance at the best, and if
the sickness is caused by the sufferer’s own fault
he will hardly get much sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">(36)</span></p>

<p>Again, if you have any liquor in camp, put it
in the hands of the most level-headed man in
the party, and use it only moderately. I am not
preaching a temperance lecture, but the use of
liquor should be in moderation, if used at all.
When drinking, hunting and fishing go together,
the hunting and fishing get poor attention.</p>

<p>The first night that you are in camp will
probably be destitute of many of the conveniences,
for you seldom get well settled. About
all that is really necessary is to get the beds
well established and a light supper prepared.</p>

<p>The next day, get all the camp luxuries fixed
up. Make some hooks on the trunks of the
nearest trees to hang the odds and ends on.
These may be nails, or they may be forked twigs
pinned to the wood. Sort out the provisions and
put them where they will keep sweet and dry.
Do not lay the pork on the sugar bag, nor the
salt against anything else.</p>

<p>The beds are of prime necessity. If you must
economize on anything, let it not be on the
bedding. If you are where you can get plenty
of fir or spruce boughs, you have the finest bed
in the world. Cut a large supply and spread
them over the sleeping place. Start with the
larger pieces and lay a row along the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">(37)</span>
the bunking place. Then work toward the foot,
lapping them like shingles till the bed is at least
seven feet long. Next start again at the head
and put on another layer, forcing the butts down
into the first layer. Continue this process, using
smaller branches with each layer, finishing off
with the fine tips on top. Make this bed as thick
as you can, for it will settle with use. When
you have nothing else to do, put some more fir
tips on the top. Lay the rubber blankets on
this, and make up each man’s blanket separately,
so that he can easily crawl into it and cover up,
without disturbing the others.</p>

<p>If “fir browse” is scarce or absent, make a
pole bed. Cut four sticks with a crotch at one
end. They should be at least three inches in diameter.
Force these into the ground so that the
head and foot of the bed shall be about seven
feet apart, and so placed that poles of about the
same size shall lie across the head and foot.
Across the poles lay other smaller ones close together
till the frame is wide enough to accommodate
the party. On this foundation lay the brush
or dry leaves.</p>

<p>When nothing else is available, and I am in a
camp that is to be permanent, I generally buy a
bale of cheap hay, if I can get it. There is generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">(38)</span>
a farmer who can supply it, or it can be
obtained at the point of disembarkation and
brought in with the luggage. This may seem
fussy, but I am supposed to be writing for the
benefit of people who are accustomed to soft
beds, and who come to camp to enjoy themselves.
If you wish to “rough it,” spread your blanket
for one night on the ground beneath the starry
sky. The next night you will have a bed made.</p>

<p>A convenient bed is made of a strip of canvas,
6&#189; feet square, doubled and sewn together
at the sides, with the ends open. When you put
it up, drive four crotched sticks into the ground
at the four corners and stretch on poles placed on
these crotches.</p>

<p>The next important adjunct is the camp fire.
It seems almost superfluous to tell a man how
to build a fire, but it is an old saying, that “It
takes a wise man or a fool to make a good fire.”
I take it the reader classes himself as neither.
The cooking fire will be the most important. If
you have flat stones, lay up a fireplace, placing
the stones close enough together so that the
fire will play all around the kettle, and with a
space long enough to hang two pots. It is a
good idea to have a low place in front wide
enough to set on the fry pan, and high enough so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">(39)</span>
that you may haul the live coals between them.
This will save you holding the pan in your hand
all the time you are using it.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_039_small" style="max-width: 66.6875em;">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_039.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_039_small.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption class="caption">Matasiso Stove</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you are in a permanent camp where there
are plenty of rocks, build a pier of stones about
three feet high, leaving a hollow in the center for
a fireplace, which may have a bottom of turf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">(40)</span></p>

<p>This device will save a good many back aches.
Make the fireplace at the back a little narrower
than the fry pan, and wider at the front. On this
you may boil your potatoes, make your coffee,
and fry your fish at the same time. The rocks
will hold the heat, and food may be kept warm
while waiting, if care is taken to have the stones
on the top flat and level; in fact, I have often
stewed fruit, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, with the dish on the edge of
the fireplace.</p>

<p>In temporary camp, cut three logs, about a foot
in diameter; lay one for a back log, two for side
logs, build your fire on top with small stuff, and
when it falls in coals you have a convenient place
to set your fry pan, coffee can, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></p>

<p>Remember that a small fire is better than a
large one. With the latter you cook your face
more than your food, and there is more liability
of spoiling the cooking.</p>

<p>Hard wood is better than pine or spruce; the
coals are what you want, and the longer they will
remain hot the better for the cook. By no means
use hemlock or cedar, as the sparks fly all over
everything, burning the towels and the cook,
soiling the food and setting fire to the surrounding
dry leaves.</p>

<p>Although I prefer “frying pan bread,” I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">(41)</span>
an oven to bake beans, fish, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, and construct
it as follows: Dig a hole in the ground, preferably
on the side of a knoll; line it with rocks, if
possible; build a fire of hard wood within it and
keep it up for a half hour at least, till the rocks
or the surrounding earth is very hot; rake out
the coals and ashes, leaving three to four inches
of live coals and ash in the bottom. Put in
whatever you have to bake, cover with the ashes.
The length of this operation will depend upon so
many conditions that it will be impossible to set
a time, but a little experience will soon settle
the question.</p>

<p>The evening camp fire is a great comfort, and
is an altogether different proposition. Select a
place in front of the tent, and some ways from
it, and place a big log, or pile up several smaller
ones with stakes to hold them in place, for a
back log. Build the fire in front of it. Start
the bottom with fine dry chips, branches, or
shavings, place larger dry branches on these and
top off with good sized pieces. After it is well
alight, it will consume damp or even green wood.
The back log will reflect the heat into the tent,
and will hold the fire for a long time.</p>

<p>Supposing that you wake in the morning with
a steady rain pouring down. Do not try to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">(42)</span>
make a shift with “cold grub.” That is the
time you need a warm meal. Put your rubber
blanket over your shoulders, and go out. If you
are wise, you will have prepared a store of dry
soft wood, which will be stored in the tent, but
if you have used it up or have neglected this
precaution, hunt up a pine log or a dead pine
tree, and chop off the outside; you will find
plenty of dry wood inside. Rake open the ashes
in the camp fire, where you will probably find
plenty of live coals, put on your dry chips, cover
with pine, fir or spruce boughs, blow up the fire
and you will soon have heat enough to keep the
tent dry, and coals enough to cook by. It will
take a pretty hard rain to put out a good fire if
once under headway.</p>

<p>If there are any mosquitoes, as when are there
not, fasten the netting over the opening of the
tent. Hard wood splinters will do the trick.
Keep this netting in place as much as possible.
It is much easier to keep these pests out, than to
get them out afterwards. If these insects are
too troublesome use the Insect Repellent freely.
There are numerous preparations which can be
purchased ready made. The most of them answer
the purpose very well. But if you wish
to make it yourself, the following recipe, furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">(43)</span>
me by Dr. L. O. Howard, the U. S. Entomologist,
is easily mixed and very good.</p>

flies, mosquitoes or horse flies, and will do no
injury to the skin. Please wash your hands,
however, before you mix the bread.</p>

<span class="title">CLEANING FISH</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p>The remarks that follow are intended for the
novice in the Waltonian pursuit, rather than for
the experienced angler or camper, the latter probably
knowing from experience how to care for
and dress his catch to his own satisfaction, and
probably in a better manner than the writer; but
for the benefit of the uninitiated I will attempt
to describe what I consider, after several years’
experience in the sport of Uncle Izaak and the
care of the results, the best methods of procedure.</p>

<p>One of the most important points to be considered
is, What means shall we employ to insure
our fish being in good condition on our arrival
at camp or at the point where the catch is to be
cleaned.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="i_045_small" style="max-width: 40.75em;">

  <figcaption class="caption">Fish-bag</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The angler who fishes the stream can, of
course, only put his fish in the creel, but if the
sun is bright, a layer of damp moss will prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">(45)</span>
the fish from drying, which is of the utmost importance.
But to the boat fisher the ensuing remarks
are of salient value. It has been my experience
that if the boat used has not a fish-well
built in it, it is best to use an open-mouthed
knit fish bag, made of extra heavy cotton cord
with an inch mesh, which can be hung over the
shady side of the boat, thereby keeping the fish
in their native element, and generally alive for
a long time, away from the sun. This is of the
utmost importance, as the sun has a very detrimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">(46)</span>
effect on the fish, oftentimes softening
them so that dressing them in a presentable or
skillful manner is out of the question. The result
of this is generally more bones in the frying
pan than fish.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="i_046_small" style="max-width: 75em;">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/i_046.png"><img class="w100" src="images/i_046_small.png" alt=""></a>
  <figcaption class="caption">Fish-knife</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We have now arrived at the point where the
fish, after having furnished sport for the angler,
are of no use until some of the party displays
his skill with the knife, and the speed and results
exhibited by one who will take pains to render
himself thoroughly conversant with the following
instructions will be a revelation to the man who
spends an hour in cleaning a dozen fish for his
supper.</p>

<p>After landing, the first question often asked
is, “Who has a knife?” and everybody pulls one
out, ranging from a penknife to an 8-inch hunting
knife, neither of which, in my mind, is worth
a last year’s bird’s nest, for reasons which we
have not here space to explain. After trying
all shapes, kinds and sizes, I for my own use
prefer the shape shown in the cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">(47)</span></p>

<p>This may be made out of a <em>good</em> pocket knife,
by breaking its back and fitting a hardwood strip
in slot for blade and winding the entire handle
with strong twine.</p>

<p>The advantage in the blade being at an angle
is in its tendency to always cut deeper into the
flesh, instead of coming out of the cut, thereby
enabling the user to make long, clean cuts down
each side of the dorsal fin, which can then be
removed entirely, leaving none of the annoying
small bones to cause an inelegant flow of language
on the part of the hungry sportsman and
numerous cuts on thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>After seeing that your knife has a keen edge,
pick out a firm-fleshed yellow perch from the
bag, grasp firmly in the left hand, belly down,
the hand being closed firmly along the sides to
prevent the sharp points of the gill covers entering
the hand. Make a cut crosswise at the nape
of the neck, insert point of knife in cut and run
entire length of fish, each side of the dorsal fin,
which can then be removed entire by catching
the lower end between the thumb and knife blade
and pulling quickly upward toward the head.
Then grasp the flap of skin at the nape between
the thumb and the point of the knife and pull
outward and downward, tearing the skin from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">(48)</span>
the side down nearly to the anal fin; repeat this
on the other side; then grasp in the same manner
the skin on the under side as near the vent as
possible, so that both sides may be removed at
the same time, and tear quickly down to the tail,
the anal fin nearly always coming off with the
skin; pull off the head and the entrails will come
with it, the whole operation requiring five cuts
with the knife and eight motions of the hand,
and less time than it takes to tell it.</p>

<p>In dressing white perch, first scale them thoroughly,
which operation consists in holding knife
blade at an angle of about 100 degrees to the
skin of the fish; press lightly and by a series of
quick, short, scraping movements from the tail
toward the head, remove all the scales thoroughly.
The dorsal fin is best removed as in
dressing yellow perch. Next, with fish in left
hand, belly up, make a downward cut from directly
back of the pectoral fins to a point just
back of the gills; insert point of knife into this
cut and run entire length of belly, continuing
down one side of anal fin, make a cut on the opposite
side and remove the fin entire; turn the
fish over, sever the neck at the nape, and the head
and entrails will be removed as in previous case.</p>

<p>Pickerel should be thoroughly scaled, and afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">(49)</span>
cleanly scraped with the knife until the
slime is entirely removed, leaving the fish nice
and white, which takes away all the disagreeable
muddy flavor so common in this fish. Fins
should be removed as in previous cases.</p>

<p>Of all fish that the novice may be called on to
dress, the Hornpout, bullhead, or Eastern cat-fish,
as it is variously called, will probably give
him the most trouble. The best and quickest
way is to remove fins by cutting down each side
and tearing out; cut the entire length of the belly
to a point a little beyond the vent; then sever
the head from the body from the under side,
without cutting the skin; grasp the body with the
fingers of the left hand, take the head in the
right and a quick pull will take off head, skin
and entrails entire, if a little care is taken in
starting the operation.</p>

<p>Of all fresh-water fish the trout is the easiest
to dress, no knife being needed. Remove the
gills and entrails with the thumb and forefinger,
wash thoroughly, and the fish is ready for the
pan.</p>

<p>In closing, a word to the camper. Never use
fish that have lain in the sun or have begun to
soften. They are not only less palatable than
freshly caught fish, but at times positively dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">(50)</span>
to the health. Take all such fish, chop
them up and take them, with the entrails and
other refuse of the cleaned fish, out to the fishing
ground and throw them overboard. If this
is done daily at the same spot, especially if near
some sunken ledge, you will be able to catch a
dinner there at any time, as the fish will congregate
there in large numbers. This is called
ground-baiting.</p>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="title">WHAT TO DO IF LOST IN THE WOODS</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p>Every man who goes camping in the woods,
at a distance of more than five miles from civilization,
and does what nearly every man does do,
i. e., “take a walk to see the country,” is liable
to miss his way and if he is not lost, the camp
is. I have talked about this with a few people
who have been in that unenviable position and
the answer to the question is difficult and varied.
“You just can’t tell what you would do.” You
may theorize all you choose beforehand, but when
the time comes and your brain is bewildered, you
would take the most solemn oath that your compass
is wrong. It is a most horrible sensation
to find that you do not know how to get out of
the woods, with perhaps miles of almost trackless
forest before you; the one safe place, perhaps,
is only a short distance away, but you do not
know where that way is.</p>

<p>I have roamed the woods for thirty years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">(52)</span>
sometimes being in camp from May 1st to December
1st. I have hunted summer and winter
in strange localities, as naturalist, sportsman and
surveyor, and while I do not know as much
woodcraft as I wish I did, I have had some experience
in getting lost—and finding myself
again; in fact, I have a faculty for getting lost.
When I am following a rare or unknown bird I
endeavor to keep my eye on it, irrespective of
the direction in which it may take me, sometimes
across country and often in circles, and when I
get ready to resume my quiet path I know not
where I am. So I have adopted a positive
maxim: “Whatever you do, do not get rattled
and lose your head.”</p>

<p>I often have had to caution a “<i lang="pt">novo</i>” who
looked to me for instruction in the woods, to remember
the above every minute, and to add to it
“Always carry a compass and <em>never</em> think that it
lies.” Most people have heard of local attraction
in the compass, and they always think they
have found it. There is only about one per cent.
of the country that will show anything of the
kind and even then it would not deflect the needle
enough to carry the traveler far astray. If it
were deflected, the needle would keep you from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">(53)</span>
wandering in circles in which lies the greatest
danger of being lost.</p>

<p>Now supposing that you are camping on the
shore of a lake in the woods, and you want to
look over the neighborhood. Your first duty is
to look at a map of the locality, if you have not
already done so, so that you may have a general
idea of the characteristics of the surrounding
country; especially of the trend of the hills, the
locations of streams or roads or the direction of
the coast or lake shore, as compared with your
camp. If you cannot do this do not go.</p>

<p>When you find that you do not know where
you are, and you are positive that the sun is
setting in the east or in some other impossible
quarter, endeavor to make up your mind as to
where you are within a radius of five miles, and
think in which general direction lies some river,
road or other landmark, and then set up a stick
or blaze a tree in that direction. If it is not too
late in the day, make up your mind in which
direction you ought to go, set your compass,
take a bearing on some prominent tree or other
mark in that course, and go to it. If the woods
are so thick that you cannot pick out a mark,
set up a peeled stick or blaze a tree once in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">(54)</span>
while so you can look back and see your trail.
When you have gone as far in any direction as
you are certain of your course, lay it out again,
always by compass, and you will come out somewhere
at a place that you will recognize as leading
to some known point.</p>

<p>If it is late in the day, do not wander around
in the dark, but pick out a comfortable place, cut
some boughs to lie upon and to build a lean-to;
gather fire-wood enough to last through the
night or as long as you want it to, and make
yourself as comfortable as possible until morning.
If you are fortunate enough to have some
lunch with you, you will probably get a fair
night’s sleep. You will not starve in one night,
and you can usually find something to eat, even
if it is not so nice. In very few places would
there be the slightest danger of molestation from
any source. Next morning you may follow the
instructions for getting out, as shown in the preceding
paragraphs.</p>

<p>Methinks I hear someone say, suppose you
have no map, compass, matches, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr> I reason
that you are a rational being and if you have not
these things you will not be foolish enough to
go out. If you do not know how to provide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">(55)</span>
yourself with the necessary comforts, you have
not read this book understandingly.</p>

<p>In the case of a hunting party in the deep
woods, it is the custom among the parties with
which I have been associated, to have a “lost
call.” We generally separate in the morning to
hunt in different sections, which are duly allotted
beforehand, so that each member knows just
where the other men ought to be. In case any
one of them becomes so overcome with the ardor
of the chase, or in the following of wounded
game, that he does not know how to get back to
camp, he gives the call, three shots of the rifle
in succession. If not replied to, the lost one
starts in the direction that he believes the camp
to be situated, repeating the signal occasionally.
Usually he is heard before much time has elapsed
and is answered. If he does not show up by
dark, a search party is formed, and he is trailed
by the light of birch bark torches, or the lanterns.
Seldom is a man compelled to stay out all night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CAMP_COOKING">CAMP COOKING</h2>
</div>


<p>The following receipts for cooking are the result
of many years’ actual experience, and have
all been tried in actual camp-life. They are all
comparatively simple, and may be prepared by
aid of the utensils mentioned in these pages.
The materials may generally be easily obtained
at the stores, when fitting out, or of the farmers
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It is assumed that a certain judgment will be
exercised in the selection of rations, to govern
the personal tastes of the various members of
the party, and the resources of the surrounding
country. One would not expect to have a variety
of fresh vegetables in the Maine Woods; nor
would it be reasonable to neglect such opportunities
when offered. Hence a selection is presented,
which may be presumed to fit all conditions.</p>

<span class="title">CAMP COOKING</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p>There is a favorite saying in camp, that “the
Lord sends grub, but the devil sends cooks.”
This expression is old and homely, but it is apt,
and many times, when it is the turn of the greenest
man in camp to get dinner, we find reason
to consider it true. We have seen an old woodsman
toss together a few ingredients and turn out
a meal that would cause our stomachs to cry,
“Encore, encore,” and we have most of us experienced
the sad results from guides who pretended
to be finished cooks and had the whole
party homesick before they had been in camp
three days. The best supplied camp cuisine in
the world would not keep off the “blue horrors”
when in the hands of such bunglers.</p>

<p>Of course, everyone must first learn the how
to do it, and equally of course some fail to ever
learn. The latter could not boil water without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">(60)</span>
burning it. I well remember my own first experience,
and I remember, too, the experiences
with some of the boys that I have tried to teach
to cook.</p>

<p>The genuine camper is, certainly, the man
who, taking but little food with him, lives upon
the spoils of his rod and gun. This is, in most
cases, impracticable to the ordinary camper. In
the first place, it takes some experience to do it.
In the second place, but few desire to do so, and
there is no reason why they should. A party
can live just as well in camp as they can at home,
if they wish to, and can afford it. And also a
party can live on a dollar a week apiece, if they
choose; and live well, too.</p>


<h4>BREAD AND CEREALS.</h4>

<p class="recipe"><i>Baked Bread</i>:—Put in the mixing dish (I
use the stew pan), 1 quart of flour, 4 teaspoonfuls
of baking powder, and a teaspoonful of salt,
and mix together; then work in a little butter
with the hand or mixing spoon, add cold water,
stirring all the time, till you have a stiff dough
without lumps. Turn it out on a plate, wash the
dish thoroughly, grease the inside so the dough
will not stick. Put the dough back in the dish,
cover it with a tin plate, place it on the coals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">(61)</span>
in the oven, and cover with the hot coals and
ashes that you have just raked out. Leave it
for from one to two hours. A little experience
will be needed to know just how long to bake
it, for a rock oven, with a heavy bed of coals,
will bake more quickly than a hole in the ground
with pine embers. (N. B. I use double the
quantity of baking powder in camp, that I use
at home, because I have found it necessary to
obtain the desired result. Why it is, I do not
know.)</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Spider-cake</i>:—Mix 1 pint wheat flour, 1 teaspoonful
salt and 2 of baking powder. Add
water to make a thick batter. Grease the fry
pan, and turn in the batter; bake very slowly
over the fire. As soon as the crust forms on
the bottom, so that it can be moved without
breaking, loosen it in the pan with a thin knife,
and shake it occasionally to keep it from scorching.
When baked on one side, turn it over and
bake the other side. (This is not called spider-cake
on account of the insects that might fall into
it, while in process of cooking, but because in
olden times the fry pan was called a spider.)</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Flapjacks</i> or <i>Batter-cakes</i>:—Mix 1 quart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">(62)</span>
flour, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 4 of baking powder,
and 4 of sugar or a little molasses. Add water
to make a thin batter. If you have milk, it may
be used instead of the water, to the benefit of the
cakes. A teaspoonful of condensed milk dissolved
in the water is also good. Grease the
fry pan and drop in enough batter to make a
thin layer. As soon as the cake browns on the
under side, slip a thin knife or cake-turner under
it and turn it over. When baked, take it off
onto a plate, placed where it will keep warm:
grease the pan again and repeat the operation.
The best results will be obtained by keeping
the inside of the pan smooth, and using as little
grease as possible. This receipt may be varied
in many ways. A mixture of corn meal and
flour in equal parts will give variety.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Rice-cakes</i> and <i>Oatmeal-cakes</i> are simply the
above mixture with the addition of 2 cups of
boiled rice or rolled oats or hominy mixed with
one-half the above quantity of flour. If eggs
are obtainable, one or two stirred into the batter
just before cooking, improves the cakes immensely.
If whortleberries or dangleberries or
blueberries are in season, stir in a cupful. The
boys will like them. My experience has taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">(63)</span>
me that an extra quantity of berry flapjacks will
be about the right size. Maple syrup, molasses,
or sugar, may be used with these.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Boiled Rice</i>:—Wash clean 1 pound of rice,
and put in 2 quarts of boiling water with 2
teaspoonfuls of salt. Boil one-half hour. Take
off and drain, cover the dish tightly and set aside
to steam.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Corn-meal Mush</i>:—Have a dish of boiling
water, salted to taste. Sift in the cornmeal
slowly with the one hand, while stirring briskly
with the other, until the porridge is thick enough.
This may seem very trivial, but it takes patience
to do it properly or it will be full of lumps of
dry meal. Set it on one side the fire and steam
slowly for 15 minutes. If your patience is not
sufficient for this process, mix your meal in cold
water to make a thick batter. Have your dish
of water boiling, and turn in the batter slowly,
so as not to stop the boiling. When properly
done, and it is not so easy either, this makes a
good dish for the camper. The remainder may
be put one side until cold, sliced in pieces about
one-half an inch thick, and fried in butter. This
is improved by dipping the slices in beaten egg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">(64)</span>
before frying. If the mush has not been properly
made at first, the slices will fall in pieces.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Milk Toast</i>:—If you have any stale bread in
camp (as when do you not, if anybody goes near
a bakeshop on the visit to town), make it up for
milk toast. Put on the stew pan, with a cup of
milk. Put in a pinch of salt, a generous lump of
butter, and allow it to come to a boil. In the
meanwhile toast your bread to a nice brown, and
when of the right complexion, drop it into the
boiling milk.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Cereals</i>:—Of these various preparations,
their name is legion, and nearly all of them have
directions for cooking, printed on the package.
I have tried a number of them, and the receipts
hold as good in camp as at home. This is not,
however, a guarantee that the rule will always
hold good. Why it is I do not know, but some
things cannot be handled the same in camp as
when prepared over the stove at home.</p>


<p>There are various makes of prepared flours in
the market, under as many various names. As a
rule they are very handy to the camper, as they
are put up in small packages, by which the necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">(65)</span>
of breaking out a large package is
avoided, and they also avert some mistakes of
omission common to men doing work they are
not accustomed to do.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fils-d’une-chienne</i>:—Fry out the fat from
some salt pork. Soak hard-tack in water till it
is soft. Drop it in the hot fat and cook.</p>


<h4>SOUPS.</h4>

<p class="recipe"><i>Beef Stew</i>:—Take 1 pound of lean meat,
wash clean, and put it in cold water over a slow
fire. Cook until the meat falls in pieces when
stirred; this will take from 3 to 4 hours, during
which time there must be enough water to cover
the meat. Now add about a quart of sliced potatoes,
a small onion, sliced very thin, and cook
until the potatoes are soft. Season with salt and
pepper to taste.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Camp Stew</i>:—Prepare the beef by boiling as
in the previous receipt, except that a large onion
is needed, and it must be added at the same time
the meat is put on. When the meat is done,
add the potatoes as before, and a can of tomatoes.
Flavor with salt, pepper and curry powder.
Just before serving, take some wheat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">(66)</span>
flour and mix with water to make it about the
consistency of cream; beat it together thoroughly
so there will be no lumps; have the stew boiling,
and turn in the flour, which will thicken the
liquid. This dish may be varied by the addition
of any or all of the vegetables which may happen
to be within reach. Carrots, turnips, cabbage,
cauliflower, parsnips, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, should be peeled
and cut into dice of about a half-inch in diameter.
These vegetables should be cooked a little
longer than the potatoes. So far as the meat
component goes, almost any flesh is suitable.
The leftovers from the broiled steaks or chops;
chickens or fowls, ducks, grouse, shore birds or
any other meat from the roast or spit; the
greater the variety, the better the stew. If fresh
meat is purchased, get the neck, shin, bottom of
the round, or any of the inferior pieces in preference
to the, so-called, choicer cuts. Although
not so tender, they have a far richer flavor. It
is needless to say that venison, rabbits, or squirrels
are adapted to this dish.</p>

<p>A word of caution just here may not be out
of place. When making venison stew, look out
that the meat has been well bled and hung for
forty-eight hours, if possible. Otherwise you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">(67)</span>
will think you have been taking a dose of Epsom
salts.</p>

<p>When preparing rabbits and squirrels, skin
and dress, then soak the flesh in salt water over
night. This will remove the strong flavor, which
is obnoxious to many.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Turtle Soup</i>:—Parboil the meat in water, in
which has been put a small handful of salt, for
about a half hour. Take out the meat and throw
away the water. Put the meat in fresh cold
water and stew slowly till it will pull into pieces;
add a sliced onion and four large sliced potatoes,
season with salt and poultry dressing (sage,
savory, thyme and pepper or other fragrant
herbs will do as well), and thicken the same as
the Camp stew. This is for the common “mud
turtle,” and be it known that an unreasonable
prejudice exists against this animal. Properly
prepared, it is a dish for the <i>gourmet</i>.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Skunk Stew</i>:—I was in doubt whether to insert
this here, on account of the prejudice that
some people have against this animal. Properly
prepared, it is really a delicacy. When you
catch a skunk, of course you kill him, if you can,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">(68)</span>
before he explodes. If the odor is strong, hang
the carcass over a smudge of hemlock twigs, being
careful not to scorch the fur. Skin and
dress, being careful not to break the musk-glands,
which must be carefully removed. Put
in cold water over a slow fire, and boil for an
hour, or as long as any fat will rise to the top.
Skim off this fat and carefully preserve it in a
bottle, against the time when the baby has the
croup, or you yourself have a sprained muscle;
it is very penetrating. Throw away the water,
and boil the meat with a sliced onion in fresh
water, till the meat will slip off the bones. Add
sliced potatoes and season with salt, pepper, and
a very little sage or poultry dressing. Many a
man has become a confirmed mephitiphagist
after partaking of the above without knowing
what he was eating until he had finished his
meal.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Lob-scouse</i>:—Boil corned beef till the excess
of salt is out of it. Drain off the water and fill
up with fresh water; put any vegetables that you
happen to have, except the potatoes, and boil till
the meat will come to pieces; about half an hour
before it is done, add some sliced potatoes and
hard bread. This is not a dainty dish, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">(69)</span>
affords a variety when the stomach is cloyed
with a hard-times diet. Start with <em>cold</em> water.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fish Chowder</i>:—Fry out two slices of pork
in the bottom of the kettle, and when well cooked,
turn in 2 quarts of boiling water. Add 6 large
potatoes, sliced thin, and cook until they can be
broken by the mixing spoon. Have about 3
pounds of fish cut into convenient pieces, which
should now be put in and cooked till it will break
in pieces. Then add 1 quart of milk and season
to taste with salt and pepper. When it comes
to the boiling point, break in 12 crackers. Set
it off the fire till the crackers are steamed soft
and serve. Some think that the chowder is improved
by the addition of a small onion, sliced
thin, and added when the potatoes are put in.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fish Chowder, Southern Style</i>:—Cover the
bottom of the pot with slices of fat salt pork;
over that put a layer of sliced raw potatoes; then
a layer of chopped onions; then a layer of fish,
cut into pieces, leaving out all the bones possible;
on the fish put a layer of crackers, first soaked in
water or milk. Repeat the layers, except the
pork, till a sufficient quantity is obtained. Each
layer should be seasoned with salt and pepper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">(70)</span>
Put in enough cold water to moisten the whole
mass well, cover the kettle closely, and cook
slowly for an hour or more. When it appears
rather thick, stir it gently and serve.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Webster Chowder</i>:—The famous Daniel
Webster lived in the section where my ancestors
passed their lives, and his neighbors, for miles
around, gleaned a portion of their sustenance
from the contiguous waters. Many of them
were professional fishermen and their wives were
famous cooks in the direction of these products.
As Webster’s Chowder was a noted receipt, it being
said that he furnished the following to his
friends, we need no excuse for its insertion here.</p>

<p>“Cod of 10 or 12 pounds well cleaned, leaving
on the skin, cut into slices of 1&#189; pounds each,
preserving the head whole; 1&#189; pounds clear, fat
salt pork cut in thin slices; slice twelve potatoes.
Take the largest pot you have, try out the
pork first, take out the pieces of pork, leaving
in the dripping; add to that three pints of
water, a layer of fish so as to cover the bottom
of the pot, next a layer of potatoes, then two tablespoonfuls
of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper,
then the pork, another layer of fish and the remainder
of the potatoes; fill the pot with water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">(71)</span>
enough to cover the ingredients; put it over a
good fire, let the chowder boil twenty-five minutes;
when this is done have a quart of boiling
milk ready and ten hard crackers split and
dipped in cold water; add milk and crackers, let
the whole boil five minutes. The chowder is then
ready and will be first rate if you have followed
the directions. An onion is added if you like
that flavor.”</p>

<p>Once or twice each summer, it was the custom
of the farmers to make up a party and go to some
beach for a picnic. A chowder was considered
a necessary adjunct of the festivities, and I still
retain lively recollections of the quality of this
toothsome dish. Perhaps it was flavored with
the sauce of youth and hunger, but it was good
then and is now.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Clam Chowder</i>:—Shuck out a peck of clams
and add to the chowder instead of the fish. For
those who have never learned the art of shucking
clams, the shellfish may be put on the fire in
a kettle, with just enough water to cover them.
Please use hot water, turned over the clams, so
as to avoid trouble with the Society for P. O. C.
T. A. When the clams open their shells, take
the kettle off the fire, turn them out into a pan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">(72)</span>
to cool, saving the liquor to use in the chowder.
Shell out the clams. Make the chowder as by
the first receipt given, using as much of the clam
water as is necessary; the children will take care
of the remainder as a beverage. Do not put the
clams into the chowder until it is nearly done, or
they will be tough.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Bean Soup</i>:—Wash 2 quarts of beans, and
either put them to soak over night or parboil
them till the skins begin to peel off. Scrape
clean one pound of salt pork and cut into thin
slices. Boil the beans for an hour or longer if
necessary, then mash the beans into a pulp; put
in the pork and cook slowly for another hour.
Stir occasionally so it will not burn. Season
with salt and pepper to taste. It is a fussy job
to make this and not burn it, and at the same
time have it good; but it is worth the while.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Pea Soup</i>:—Take a ham bone, from which
the most of the meat has been sliced. There is
no objection if it has been once boiled. Put over
the fire with cold water and cook until the bone
will slip out of the meat. Then add split peas
and cook till soft. Have some cubes of bread,
about one inch square, prepared, fried in lard or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">(73)</span>
butter. When the soup has thickened, which it
will do as soon as the peas are cooked soft,
put in the bread, and serve immediately.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Oyster Stew</i>:—Half a cup of oysters
(shucked, if you please), with a very little
water; simmer over the fire till the beards
wrinkle. Turn in a pint of milk, a piece of butter,
salt and pepper; let it come to a boil, stir in
a little thickening, and it is ready to eat. Don’t
burn your tongue.</p>


<h4>MEATS.</h4>

<p>Unless camping in a game country, we seldom
have any other meat than what may be brought
into camp on the occasional visits to town. But
it has been thought advisable to treat the subject
as if there were a market within easy access,
for the benefit of those who may be thus
advantageously placed. Deer, bear, hares, squirrels,
rabbits, grouse, quail and shore birds, however,
will be at times available. And as the
acme of the camper’s art is to live, so far as
possible, off the country, due attention will be
paid to those dishes which can be prepared from
those products. No hard and fast rules can
be made, for individual preferences vary to such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">(74)</span>
an extent that what would be luxury to the one,
would be starvation to another. Nevertheless, it
may be considered that all wild meats should be
well done, except in the case of an occasional
chop from some member of the deer family.
With fowl, however, it is different. All dark
meated birds should be rare done; all white
meated birds well cooked. I consider that criticism
of a man’s epicurean tastes is pure impudence,
if not insult. It is none of my business
if a man wants to make a <i>salmi</i> of his woodcock:
I simply deplore his taste or ignorance.</p>

<p>I shall commence with what has probably been
brought in when the party arrived, so the cook
will not have to hunt far to know how to cook
supper. Beef, pork, lamb, ham, bacon, sausage,
<abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Broiled Steaks</i>:—Camp is a poor place for
tough meat; so when you buy, get something
so that you can, at least, stick a fork in the gravy
when it is cooked. Have a good bed of hardwood
coals, if possible. At any rate, have no
smoke. Put the broiler over the hot coals and
get it hissing hot. Then put on the steak and
hold it over the fire till one side is seared; turn
the other side to the fire and sear that, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">(75)</span>
which it should be turned back and forth till
cooked to suit the taste. Lay on a warm plate,
put on a liberal piece of butter, a little salt and
pepper, and give thanks that you have been
given a palate to appreciate good food. This
rule applies to lamb as well as beef; to venison
as well as to pork chops. In cooking pork chops,
however, my preference is, to heat the fry pan
very hot, drop in the meat, and cook till well
done. If there is no broiler, this plan may be
followed with any meat, but a little butter must
be used, if there is not sufficient fat in the meat
to prevent its sticking to the pan. But by all
means, use as little grease as possible, and have
the pan hot, to start with, so as to quickly sear
the surface and keep in the juices. In cooking
meats, in the fry pan, if there is any fat left,
especially that from pork and bacon, turn it into
a clean can (I use the empty condensed milk
cans), and save it to fry fish.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Salt Pork</i>:—Slice clear, fat pork; slash
the rind edge, so it will not curl in the pan;
scrape off all bits of salt or other attachments;
put in a cold fry-pan and cook till well done. Do
not get the pan too hot, for it will burn the
grease, and spoil the flavor. Drain off grease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">(76)</span>
and serve with hot potatoes. Good salt pork is
smooth and dry. Damp, clammy pork is unwholesome.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Broiled Salt Pork</i>:—Slice thin and toast on
the broiler, the same as steaks. Or hold the
slices over the fire, on the end of a green switch.
Look out that the smoke from the drippings
does not reach the meat.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Bacon</i>:—Slice thin and drop into a hot
pan. Watch carefully that it does not cook too
much, or it will be hard and dry; remove each
piece as soon as it is done and drain dry. Some
cooks always lay the cooked meat on paper to
absorb the grease. Do not soak in water before
cooking; it renders it hard when done.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Ham and Eggs</i>:—Fry the ham the same as
pork. When cooked, break the eggs separately
into a cup, and drop into the hot fat. The
white of the egg will spread out and should be
turned up against the yolk as soon as it gains sufficient
consistency; this prevents the outside of
the albumen from becoming leathery. The object
of breaking the eggs into a cup before dropping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">(77)</span>
into the pan, is to avoid getting an ancient
egg among the others.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Sausages</i>:—Cut the links apart, prick
each sausage with a sharp fork so they will not
burst in cooking. Place in the cold fry pan, and
cook until well done. It is not safe to eat any
pork product unless it is well cooked.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Boiled Beef</i>:—Put the meat into boiling
water, so that it will be covered and cook till
tender; about 15 minutes to the pound will generally
be sufficient. Use a teaspoonful of salt
for every 5 pounds of meat, added when it is
nearly cooked. This method will be proper for
corned beef, also, but omit salt and use cold
water. If the beef is not corned, just before it
is done allow the liquor to boil away to about
a pint, season with pepper, and thicken with
flour; this makes an excellent gravy. If no
gravy is desired, the liquor should be set one
side till cool, the hardened fat removed and
saved to fry with. Afterward, if desired, this
liquor may be used for a foundation for a vegetable
stew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">(78)</span></p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Hash</i>:—Take of boiled beef, or the scraps
left in slicing the boiled ham, one part; cold,
boiled potatoes, two parts. Chop into small bits,
and warm up in the fry pan with a little pork
fat. If desired this may be varied in several
ways. Have the fry pan hissing hot. Put in a
little pork fat and drop in an onion, sliced very
fine. Stir rapidly, so it will not burn. Have
the hash prepared, which roll into flat croquettes,
dip in sifted corn meal and fry brown in the fat,
from which the pieces of onion have been removed.
Or, have the pan half filled with clean,
sweet grease (lard, or beef drippings), slightly
salted. Break one or two eggs into the hash and
mix thoroughly; roll into croquettes or balls,
drop into the hot fat and fry brown. The fat
should be as hot as it can be without burning.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Barbecued Meat</i>:—Ribs of mutton, thin
pieces of beef, rabbits, squirrels or almost any
other flesh can be prepared in this manner. Lay
your meat on the broiler over hot coals, so as to
singe the outside immediately. After a few minutes,
move away from the intense heat a little
and cook till done through, basting frequently
with the following dressing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">(79)</span></p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Barbecue Dressing</i>:—One pint of vinegar,
half a can of tomatoes, two teaspoonfuls of red
pepper (chopped pepper-pods are better), a teaspoonful
of black pepper, same of salt, two tablespoonfuls
of butter. Simmer together till it is
completely amalgamated. Have a bit of clean
cloth or sponge tied on the end of a stick, and
keep the meat well basted with the dressing as
long as it is on the fire. The preparation of this
dish is a lot of work, but it pays.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Egg on Hash</i>:—Make your hash of
meat and potato; fry out the fat from a few
slices of pork; roll your hash, wet with enough
water to make it stick together, into flat cakes
large enough for a single service, and fry brown.
Lay in a dish where they will keep warm; grease
the fry-pan and drop in the eggs in couples, and
fry till the whites congeal; roll the edges of the
white over the yolk and slip off on to the hash
cakes, one couple to each cake. When served,
which should be as soon as the egg is done, break
the yolk and let it run down over the cake.</p>


<h4>GAME.</h4>

<p>This word, like sweet Charity, covers a multitude
of sins. I might read you a homily on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">(80)</span>
sin of killing the creatures of the wood and field;
but I am not going to do it, for several reasons.
First ’twould do no good, for you would keep on
killing. Second, it is none of my business anyway.
My business now, is to tell you how to
cook so that you will come out of the woods well
and hearty, and without a bad case of dyspepsia.
With this digression, I want to start in with a
few words of advice. In the first place, always
bleed your game as soon as killed. The flesh of
an animal that has not been bled is not fit to eat.
Always let the animal heat get out of the body
before you cook it. The fact that it will not rest
well on your stomach is proof positive that it is
not healthful. So unless you are on the verge
of starvation, heed these words. Fish is the
only meat that is not subject to this rule.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Squirrel</i>:—The most common four-legged
game that the ordinary camper will get,
are squirrels and rabbits. The latter, however,
are not suitable for food till the late summer, and
in most sections are protected by law for a certain
season of the year. We, however, are not
just now interested in the getting of them, but
the cooking. Skin and dress them carefully, and
parboil for half an hour in salt and water, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">(81)</span>
take out the strong flavor. Drain off the water,
drop the meat in the pan, with a bit of butter and
a dash of curry powder, and brown. Those who
like the gamey flavor, sometimes soak the squirrels
in salt and water for an hour, wipe dry,
and broil over the coals with a slice of pork fat
laid over the meat to baste it so it will not be
dry.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Rabbit</i>:—Dress four rabbits; parboil in
salt and water till the bones will slip out of the
meat. Drain off the water and fry the meat in
butter. It is much better if the bones are all
taken out before frying, although not at all
necessary.</p>

<p>Woodchucks, porcupines and skunks are not
strictly game, but they are fully as edible as
other animals, and, if properly cooked, very delicate.
They should be parboiled thoroughly, and
then roasted or stewed like any game.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Roast Woodcock or Quail</i>:—Dress and impale
with a green stick (black birch is the best
for the spit), and put a slice of fat pork on the
end of the spit, so the fat will drip down over
the bird as it roasts. Have a large quantity of
very hot coals; thrust the stick into the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">(82)</span>
in front of the fire, in an inclined position, so
the bird will be over the heat. Turn frequently,
in order to cook on all sides and also to avoid
burning. The hotter the coals, the better the
bird, for the intent is to sear over the outside as
quickly as possible to avoid loss of the juices.
Any small bird, like snipe, plover or other sandpipers
may be cooked in the same manner.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Rabbit Curry</i>:—Dress two rabbits and boil
till the flesh will come off the bones. Take the
bones out and put the meat in the kettle with
a large cupful of the water in which it was
boiled. (Do not use too much of this liquor;
it will make the curry taste rank.) Add two
slices of bacon, cut in strips; season with curry
powder, salt and pepper. If you have it, put in
a small glass of Burgundy. Cook slowly for
twenty minutes. Have dish lined with boiled
rice; take out the meat from the stew, and lay it
in the dish; thicken the liquor left in the <span class="cor" title="Source: kettle, with" id="cor82">kettle
with</span> a little flour rubbed up in cold water; turn
over the meat in the dish. Serve.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Roast Grouse au naturel</i>:—Take out the “innards”
and fill the cavity with the following
dressing. Roll crackers into crumbs and mix<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">(83)</span>
with a little salt, pepper and sage; turn a little
hot water on to moisten the crackers. Put this
in the bird, cover with a thin slice of pork and
sew the skin together tightly. Have a pail of
water in which stir clay until it is of the consistency
of thick porridge or whitewash. Now
take the bird by the feet and dip into the water.
The clay will gather on and between the feathers.
Repeat till the bird is a mass of clay. Lay
this in the ashes, being careful to dry over the
outside of the clay, before you get it into the fierce
heat of the fire. Bake it till the clay is almost
burned to a brick. Rake the bird out of the fire,
and rap the ball of clay with a stone or stick,
till it cracks open. The feathers and skin will
all come off with the clay, leaving the meat as
clean as possible. This is the perfect way of
cooking game. Any fowl or animal may be
cooked in the same way. If you try ducks,
woodchucks or hedgehogs chop an onion and add
to the stuffing.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Partridge Fricassee</i>:—Divide your birds into
joints and roll them in flour; put in the fry pan a
generous lump of butter, heat very hot and put
in your pieces of bird. Cook for about ten minutes,
then add water to keep from burning and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">(84)</span>
cook slowly till the meat is tender. Take up the
meat and put in a dish; turn in the pan enough
water to make a gravy, thicken it with a little
flour rubbed up in cold milk; salt it a little and
pour it over the birds.</p>


<h4>FISH.</h4>

<p>There is such a difference in fish taken from
different waters, that any general rule for cooking
may lead to distaste and disappointment by
reason of the poor quality of the flesh. Fish
taken from sluggish, muddy waters are decidedly
inferior to the same species taken from the cold,
clear streams and ponds. Soaking in salt and
water before cooking will improve these inferior
fish, but all the preparation in the world will
not make them taste like the fish caught in clear
waters. Again, if you have not a fish car or
net, or a well in the boat, by which means they
can be kept alive till they are ready for use, always
kill your catch at once, and keep them out
of the sun. Fish that have lain in the sun for
a half hour are unfit for food. Reference to the
article on Fish Cleaning, by Mr. Bosworth, will
give you needed instructions, which it will be
well to follow. Trusting that you have studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">(85)</span>
this, I will say no more on the subject, but proceed
to the cooking.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Perch</i>:—Have the pan well supplied
with hot fat. If there is not a supply in camp,
fry the fat out of a half-pound of salt pork. Roll
the fish, previously skinned and well washed, in
corn meal or cracker crumbs. If you wish to do
it up in real fine shape, roll them first in well
beaten egg and then in crumbs. Drop in the fat
and fry brown, turning frequently, so as to have
them evenly cooked. Serve hot. This rule
holds good for all kinds of fish not over a half-pound
in weight. If larger, either cut them in
slices across the body, or slice the meat of the
sides from the backbone.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Boiled Fish</i>:—Do not attempt to boil a fish
under three pounds in weight. Have your water
boiling. Put in a couple tablespoonfuls of salt,
and drop in your fish. It is a good plan to wrap
it in a clean white cloth, so it will not fall in
pieces. Cook until the fish will easily cleave
away from the bones. A three-pound fish will
cook in half an hour or less, and about five minutes
for every extra pound may be considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">(86)</span>
about right. But there is a difference in species.
Too much cooking will spoil the flavor of some
fish, the salmon for instance, or the lake trout.
Serve with some sauce.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fish Sauce</i>:—Have a quart of water boiling
in the stew pan or the fry pan. Put in two tablespoonfuls
of butter, one teaspoonful of salt.
Mix in a cup three tablespoonfuls of flour rubbed
up in a little cold water till the lumps are all
broken, and it is of the consistency of cream.
Stir this into the boiling water slowly, so it will
not form lumps, and the sauce will thicken. Milk
in place of the water is preferable, or half milk
and half water. If you want a sour sauce, add
a teaspoonful of vinegar, but do not use milk, it
will curdle. A glass of wine in place of the
vinegar is an improvement, especially when
served with boiled trout.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Baked Fish</i>:—Take a fish of not less than
three pounds; scrape and wash it well; prepare
stuffing composed of cracker or bread crumbs, a
little salt and pepper, a small lump of butter,
seasoned with sage or poultry dressing, mixed
with a very little boiling water; if you have eggs
drop one in and mix thoroughly. Put the stuffing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">(87)</span>
in the cavity whence the entrails were removed,
not too tightly, and sew up the opening.
Rake the hot coals out of the bake-hole, put a
thick layer of green grass (if there should happen
to be some mint in it all the better), over
the hot ashes, lay the fish on this, put on another
layer of grass, rake the hot coals over all, and
build a fire on top. Bake for an hour. If you
like the flavor put a small onion in the dressing.
A few slices of bacon, laid over the fish before
covering, will improve the flavor.</p>

<p>Small fish may be prepared for the table by
baking between the layers of grass, but it will
not take so long to cook them. In fact, when
on a long tramp, in light marching order,
I prefer to cook them this way, rather than to
lug a fry pan.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Skewered Fish</i>:—Sharpen a small straight
stick and take off the bark. Thrust this through
small fish and slices of bacon alternately, and
hold over the hot coals. They will cook in a
few minutes. Look out that they do not drop
off the stick at the last stage of the game.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Broiled Fish</i>:—Take off the heads and
split down the back, leaving the skin over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">(88)</span>
stomach intact. Lay on the broiler with strips
of fat pork or bacon laid across, and cook over
hot coals. Mackerel and bluefish do not need
the fat meat, but they are by no means injured
thereby.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Planked Fish</i>:—This is the quintessence of
camp cookery, and is so easy that it is a wonder
that more people do not use the method. Have
a hard wood plank, large enough to hold the
fish, laid out flat. And do not throw away the
plank after using; it improves with use. Split
the fish down the back, as for broiling. Tack it
to the plank, skin side down. Skewer on strips
of bacon, and stand up before a hot fire. Be sure
to have a good sized piece of bacon on the head
end, so the dripping fat will baste the fish.
Cook until you can easily thrust a sliver into the
thickest part of the meat. Take off the plank,
and dress with salt, pepper and butter, and do
not be afraid to put on enough butter. Lay on
all you think the state of the supply will allow,
and then shut your eyes and put on another
piece. Serve hot.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Baked Fish, Lumberman Style</i>:—Take a
fresh caught fish and rub it in soft clay from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">(89)</span>
the river bank, against the scales and gills.
When the clay is set a little, roll the whole fish in
a blanket of clay, till the body is completely covered.
Dry in the heat of the fire for fifteen
minutes; bury in the hot coals and ashes till
the clay is hard. Rake the brick out of the fire
and crack it open with the hatchet. The fish
will split in two pieces; the spine can be easily
taken out; the “innards” are shrunk to a little
ball, which can be flipped off, and the scales are
stuck on the clay. Dust on a little salt, and you
have a meal fit for—a hungry hunter.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Oysters and Bacon</i>:—(Little Pigs in
Blankets):—Cut fat bacon in very thin slices.
Lay on each piece a large oyster, dust on a little
salt and pepper, and fold the oyster inside the
bacon, securing it with a sliver or a wooden
toothpick. Heat the fry pan very hot and drop
in the “pigs” and cook about four minutes.
The bacon must be cut as thin as possible and
the “pigs” cooked only enough to make the
bacon palatable. Some never eat the bacon at
all, but are contented with the flavor it gives
the oysters.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Clams</i>:—Shuck out the clams, selecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">(90)</span>
the large ones. Roll them in cracker crumbs
or in corn meal, and fry them in deep fat.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fish Balls</i>:—Take the fish left over from the
fry at dinner and pick out all the bones. Chop
up the cold boiled potatoes, in the proportion of
one of fish to two of potato, season with salt
to taste; break in an egg and mix thoroughly.
Form into balls or flat croquettes, and fry in
deep fat.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Baked Clams</i>:—Build an oven of rocks, on
bottom and sides, top left open. Build a hot
fire and keep it burning till there is a heap of hot
coals and ashes, and the rocks are heated through.
Rake out all the bits of unburned wood which
would burn and smoke the bake. Throw on a
layer of rock-weed to cover the ashes; lay the
clams on this, with a few ears of corn for a
relish, cover with more weed and throw an old
piece of sail over the heap. Bake till the clams
will slip in the shell. Uncover, and serve with
melted butter and vinegar.</p>


<h4>EGGS.</h4>

<p>When they can be procured, eggs are the
refuge for the hurried meal, or for lunch; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">(91)</span>
do not run away with the idea that any old way
is right to cook them. A plain boiled egg may
be delicious or it may be a clammy mass. Of
course individual taste will govern the length of
time they are cooked. A soft-boiled egg should
be cooked 3 minutes, if dropped in boiling water.
If wanted for a cold lunch, put them on
in cold water and let them come to a boil, then
cook 20 minutes. You will be surprised how
mealy and palatable the yolk will be. Some
people have the water boiling furiously, then set
off the fire, drop in the eggs, cover and let them
set 6 minutes.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Eggs</i>:—Grease the fry pan, as if for
cooking flapjacks. Have it hissing hot; break
the eggs into a cup, one by one, so as to be
sure that they are fresh; turn into the fry pan,
and when the white, which has run out, is congealed,
turn it in toward the center. Cook till
it is of the desired consistency. The egg may be
turned over, if it is desired that the yolk be
hard. Eggs fried in too much fat will be
leathery and indigestible, but if a little care be
used, and the above directions followed, they
may be as easily digested as if soft-boiled.</p>

<p>If egg sandwiches are desired for lunch, put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">(92)</span>
one of the fried eggs between two slices of bread,
flavor with salt and pepper. Have the size of
the sandwich to fit the single egg. This is better
than to make the double egg filling for the
whole slice of bread.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Scrambled Eggs</i>:—Break the eggs in a dish,
and beat the yolks and whites well together.
Grease the bottom of the fry pan with butter,
drop in the eggs and stir till done. Look out
that it does not stick on at the bottom. Season
with salt and pepper, after serving.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Omelette</i>:—Break four eggs into the mixing
dish: beat them well, and season with salt and
pepper; rub a tablespoonful of flour in four
times that quantity of milk, till it is smooth;
pour into the eggs and beat all together. Have
the fry pan well greased with butter, pour in
the mixture and let it cook till the bottom is well
set, and the top will not run; slip a thin knife
under one side and turn one-half over onto the
other. Cook as much as desired, turning occasionally,
so that it will be evenly cooked. Don’t
let it burn onto the pan; if it shows signs of
burning before it is sufficiently cooked, drop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">(93)</span>
a little piece of butter in the spot where the
danger lies, and hold off the fire for a moment.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Ham Omelette</i>:—Mince some boiled ham,
season to taste with a little curry, or other condiments,
and lay a large spoonful on the omelette
before you turn the two halves together.</p>

<p>This fancy omelette may be varied in many
ways. Minced beef, lamb, cheese, or even fish
like salt cod and smoked <span class="cor" title="Source: halbut" id="cor93">halibut</span>, gives the omelette
a distinctive flavor.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Omelette aux Fine Herbes</i>:—Break eight
eggs in the stew pan, to which add a teaspoonful
of chopped shallot or mild onion, one of chopped
parsley, half a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper,
and two large tablespoonfuls of cream; beat
them well together. Put two ounces of butter
in the fry pan, set over the fire, and as soon as
the butter has melted, so the egg will not stick,
pour in the mixture, and stir quickly until it
begins to set; hold it a moment till a crust forms
on the bottom; turn one-half over the other,
and serve. It must not be done too much.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fricasseed Eggs</i>:—Boil a half dozen eggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">(94)</span>
hard and slice them. Chop very fine a small
onion, a little parsley or celery-leaves, and two
or three mushrooms; put a generous lump of
butter in the fry pan, season with salt and pepper;
when the butter is melted, lay in the vegetables
and heat thoroughly, but do not brown;
add a gill of milk with a tablespoonful of flour
rubbed in for thickening; lay in the eggs, let it
come to a boil, and serve.</p>


<h4>VEGETABLES.</h4>

<p>All vegetables should be carefully looked over
and washed in cold water. If to be boiled, drop
them in boiling water, and if the water in the
kettle gets low during the process, fill up with
boiling water, never with cold. Keep the kettle
covered, if possible, and drain off the water as
soon as cooked. Some very strong flavored
vegetables are improved by boiling in two waters.
That is, when they are partly cooked,
drain off the water, and fill up with fresh hot
water. The question is often asked, how long
shall we boil them? I never found any hard and
fast rule. Perhaps the following table will be
of assistance, but the time is variable. Small
potatoes will cook five minutes quicker than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">(95)</span>
large ones. It is a safe rule to cook until you
can easily stick a splinter in the fleshy parts.</p>

<p>Pay the farmer for what you take, or you may
find yourself, as well as the vegetables, in hot
water.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Boiled Potatoes</i>:—Wash thoroughly in cold
water; cut out all the decayed parts. Drop them
in hot water and boil till you can easily stick a
sliver into the largest. Drain off the water and
set one side to steam. Select all potatoes for a
boiling of about the same size, so one will not
be cooked before another, as they are liable to
burst their jackets and become water-soaked or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">(96)</span>
lost. If the potatoes are very old, peel off the
skins, put a handful of salt in the water in which
they are to be boiled; have the water very hot
and cook as quickly as possible.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Mashed Potatoes</i>:—After boiling, peel and
mash thoroughly with a stick or the bottom of a
clean bottle. Stir in salt, pepper, butter and
enough milk to make the consistency that of
dough.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Baked Potatoes</i>:—Cut off the ends, bury in
the hot ashes and leave there for an hour, or until
you can pinch them with the fingers.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Boiled-fried Potatoes</i>:—Peel the skins from
cold boiled potatoes and slice. Have the bottom
of the fry pan covered with “screeching hot”
fat. Drop in the slices and stir frequently to
prevent burning. When they are slightly brown
they are ready to serve.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Stewed Potatoes</i>:—Cut cold boiled potatoes
into small pieces. Put in the stew pan with
enough milk to cover them. Season with salt,
pepper and butter, and stew gently, stirring occasionally,
until the milk is nearly boiled away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">(97)</span></p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Lyonnaise Potatoes</i>:—One quart cold boiled
potatoes cut small, three tablespoons butter, one
of chopped onions and one of chopped parsley,
salt and pepper to taste. Season the potatoes
with the salt and pepper, fry the onions in the
butter, and when they are yellow, add the potatoes;
stir with a fork, being careful not to
break them; when hot add the parsley and cook
two minutes longer. Serve at once.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Potato Salad</i>:—Ten medium-sized cold boiled
potatoes, cut into small pieces; one small onion,
chopped fine; half a dozen hard boiled eggs;
chop the whites fine, mash the yolks and add to
them one teaspoon each of ground mustard and
sugar, one tablespoon of melted butter, some salt
and pepper. Rub all together well and put in
the potatoes, with about four tablespoonfuls of
salad dressing. (This can be purchased in bottles,
and will save much trouble in making.)
Add about half a cup of vinegar. If you can
get some celery, chop up about as much as there
is of the potato, and mix all together. Lettuce,
kale, parsley or any green salad plant will do
instead of the celery, or the salad plant may be
omitted altogether, in which case, be more sparing
of the vinegar in the dressing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">(98)</span></p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Boiled Green Corn</i>:—The flavor of the corn
is better preserved if it is cooked in the husk.
Pull off the outer husk, turn down the inner
leaves, pull off the silk and turn back the inner
husk and tie the ends. Put some salt in the
water as soon as it comes to a boil and drop in
the corn. Do not let it stay in longer than is
necessary to make it soft. If one does not wish
to cook it this way, follow the same plan after
taking off the husk.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Succotash</i>—(so called): Cut the corn from
the cob and shell the beans. The proportion
should be two-thirds corn and one-third beans.
Put into the kettle with a generous piece of pork,
and boil till tender. Take out the pork, drain
off the water, add a cup of milk and a piece of
butter the size of an egg, and stir over the fire
till it boils up. Take off the fire and season to
taste with salt and pepper.</p>

<p>This is not the real succotash of the south-eastern
section of Massachusetts, where it was
first transmitted from the Indian to the first
settlers. Nearly every one of the old colonial
families has its receipt for this dish, and few
of them are alike in their detail. They are all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">(99)</span>
good enough. Suffice it to say that the body is
composed of salt beef, pork, chicken, veal, and
in many cases the remnants of the dinner, whatever
it may have been, in the line of meat, saved
by the frugal housewife. Here is one method
as given me by one of the old-time mothers of
the Cape.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Cape Cod Succotash</i>:—Boil a piece of salt
beef for an hour till the salt has got soaked out
of it. Drain off the water and fill up with fresh,
cold water. Put in some chicken, a piece of
pork about a quarter as big as the beef, and
boil till it all comes to pieces. Scrape off the
corn from the cobs and put in with about half
as many beans, and cook till the beans are tender.
Season to taste. Of course green shell
beans are what is intended in the above.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Boiled Beets</i>:—Wash the beets, but do not
break the skin, for that will make them bleed,
and thus lose some of the sweetness. Put them
in boiling water, enough to cover them, and
leave till they are tender. Drain off the water
and drop them in cold water, when the skin may
be easily rubbed off. If there are any left from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">(100)</span>
the meal, slice them into a shallow dish and
cover them with vinegar. This is a splendid
relish.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Pork and Greens</i>:—I am requested to mention
the variety of plants which may be used for
this homely dish. No one <span class="cor" title="Source: need" id="cor100">needs</span> to go hungry
in the country, for the fields are filled with edible
plants. Their list would be legion, but I
will mention a few: Dandelion, nettles, milkweed,
spinach, beet-tops, turnip-tops, mustard,
narrow dock, cowslip (marsh marigold), kale,
poke, brussels sprouts, cabbage, purslane, shepherd’s
purse, and a myriad others. Any of the
above, cleaned and boiled till tender with a generous
piece of pork, and served with boiled potatoes,
is not only satisfying, but is an excellent
corrective for the system. Of course, it is understood
that the young plants or shoots are the
portions to be used. You might as well try to
get nourishment from a piece of wood, if you
try to use them after the hard fiber has formed
in these plants.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Stewed Tomatoes</i>:—Peel by pouring boiling
water over them, when the skin will easily come
off. Cut up in the stew pan, throwing out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">(101)</span>
hard and unripe parts. Stew gently until they
come to pieces; season with butter, salt, pepper
and a little sugar if desired.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Baked Beans</i>:—This New England dish is
almost a <i lang="la">sine qua non</i> in the Eastern woods camp,
and is seen nowhere else in its perfection. Pick
over a quart of beans, discarding all poor ones.
Parboil until the skin starts. Drain off the water
and throw it far away from the camp, for it
does not smell particularly sweet. Put half the
beans in the bean pot, then a generous junk of
fat salt pork, then the rest of the beans, so that
the pork shall be bedded. A little salt and some
molasses, the quantity depending on the taste,
will complete the list. Pour in enough hot water
to cover the beans. Put on the cover of the
pot, and set in the hot ashes of the bean hole,
just before you go to bed. Rake the coals over
it, put a few sticks on top, so the ashes will keep
hot, and go to bed. In the morning rake out
the bean pot, and you will find them nicely
baked, and redolent of that aroma so dear to
every Yankee. If you do not relish it, so much
the worse for you, and so much the better for
the rest of the party, for there will be more for
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">(102)</span></p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Macaroni</i>:—Break the sticks of macaroni
into convenient lengths; put in the stew pan
with hot salted water and cook till tender. Stew
half a can of tomatoes till you can mash them up
with the spoon and pick out the skin and the
hard lumps; put in a lump of butter, a little salt
and pepper, and thicken with flour and water,
rubbed smooth. Pour this over the macaroni
and serve.</p>


<h4>MUSHROOMS.</h4>

<p>At the earnest request of a friend, but with
fear and trembling at the possible results, do I
include this chapter in these notes. There is
no shadow of doubt that men have gone hungry
in the midst of plenty, from the lack of knowledge
of the food that was all around them. But
the average camper, with his meager knowledge
of mycology, generally feels that eating wild
mushrooms is much like living over a powder
magazine. If a person of average intelligence
will take the pains so to educate himself that
he can surely identify the edible varieties, and
it needs no more than that, there is no more danger
than is present in eating the fish you catch
from the lakes. But if you are not positive that
you can identify each specimen as you gather it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">(103)</span>
let it go, and confine yourself to those that you
do know are harmless. My experience in this
direction has been so limited, that I am obliged to
copy, in most cases, from the experience of
others. There is no space here to go into descriptions
of species, but the literature on the
subject is so easily obtainable, that there seems
no need to do so.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Broiled Russula</i>:—Thoroughly clean the top
or peel off the skin; place the cap on a gridiron
over a hot fire, gills downward, and heat through,
but do not scorch. Turn over and repeat the
process; lay on a hot plate, gills upward and
drop on a piece of butter with a little salt and
pepper.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Vegetable Oyster</i>—<i lang="la">A. ostreatus</i>:—This species
grows out of the sides of trees and stumps.
Broil the young and tender specimens the same
as in the last instance; or they may be fried in
butter, or in batter, or in fact any way that the
real oyster is cooked. As a stew it is delicious.</p>

<p>The Elm Mushroom, a species of the last
named family, is cooked in the same manner,
but the flavor is decidedly that of fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">(104)</span></p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Shaggy-mane Coprinus</i>:—Put in a stew pan
with a little milk, add a piece of butter, a little
pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Or, put about two ounces of butter in the
stew pan with a teaspoonful of salt and a little
pepper, with a slight pinch of powdered mace or
nutmeg. Put in a pint of mushrooms and stew
for a few minutes; then add a little milk and
stew for about twenty minutes, or till they are
tender. Thicken the gravy with a little flour
rubbed up in milk.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Stewed <span class="cor" title="Source: Chantarelle" id="cor104">Chanterelle</span></i>:—Soak the mushrooms in
milk over night; chop up some boiled meat,
chicken, veal or lamb preferred; mix and stew
till tender; flavor with salt and pepper.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Vegetable Beefsteak</i>:—Slice young specimens
and broil over the coals, the same as you would
a nice cut off the rump. Do not spoil it with
too much condiment.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fried Clavaria</i>:—This delicious fungus is
very common and so free from insect enemies,
that pounds of it may be gathered in almost any
woods. Simply fried in the pan with butter or
oil, and properly seasoned, it has furnished an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">(105)</span>
addition to many a meager meal of the ones who
understood its value.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Puff Balls</i>:—Pick out the specimens with
white meat (they turn black as they grow older),
fry in butter and serve on toast. They are as
good as eggs.</p>

<p>After you have tried these and have become
a confirmed mycophagist, you will have obtained
literature on the subject and know how to adapt
the cooking to the characteristics of the species.</p>


<p class="p1">Warning:—Be sure that you have young
specimens, clean and free from the ravages of
insects.</p>


<h4>DESSERTS.</h4>

<p class="recipe"><i>Rice Pudding</i>:—Boiled rice, about a quart;
one can of condensed milk; one-half cup of sugar
or molasses; ground nutmeg or mace to <span class="cor" title="Source: taste: sufficient" id="cor105">taste;
sufficient</span> water to keep it from burning; one or
two eggs, if you have them: stir together and
cook over a slow fire for fifteen minutes, stirring
occasionally to keep from burning. Good,
hot or cold.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Corn-starch Pudding</i>:—Heat three pints of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">(106)</span>
milk to boiling, and watch it that it does not boil
over; have three tablespoonfuls of corn starch
rubbed up in a little cold milk; add two eggs and
a little salt, beat it together, and when the milk is
boiling stir the mixture into it. It will immediately
thicken up, when it must be taken from the
fire, turned out into a dish, and set one side to
cool. Serve with sugar and milk.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Tapioca Pudding</i>:—Buy the “minute tapioca”;
it saves time. If you have only the other
kind, soak it in milk till it swells up soft. Stir into
a quart of the jelly, or the advertised allowance
of the “minute” brand with enough milk to
make the quantity, two eggs, a little salt, spice to
taste, and set over the fire till it comes to a boil.
Set off the fire, and just before serving, put in
a dash of lemon juice or &#189; teaspoonful of essence
of lemon.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Apple Slump</i>:—Fill the kettle half full of
sliced and cored apples; sprinkle on a little spice,
one cup of sugar or molasses; cover over and
cook for a few minutes. Prepare a crust the
same as for bread or biscuits, stirring &#189; teaspoonful
of salt and two of baking powder into
a pint of flour, and wetting with milk or water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">(107)</span>
till it makes a stiff dough. Lay this dough over
the top of the apples, cover and steam till the
crust rises and you can thrust a sliver into the
crust without the dough sticking to it. Set off
the fire and keep covered till needed. Serve
with pudding sauce, or with milk and sugar.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Pudding Sauce</i>:—One pint of water in the
stew pan; mix three tablespoonfuls of flour in a
little cold water and rub it to a smooth paste:
when the water boils, put in a small lump of butter,
a cup of sugar, a little spice, and when the
sugar is dissolved stir in the flour paste. If the
water is boiling when the flour is put in, it will
thicken up into a jelly. Just before serving stir
in a little lemon juice or extract. If this flavor
is put in too soon, the savor will evaporate.
This sauce may be made of milk if you have it.
If condensed milk is used, dilute it with water,
and do not use so much sugar.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Plain Flour Pudding</i>:—Mix a quart of flour,
and a tablespoonful of baking powder, and a teaspoonful
of salt in water enough to make a thick
dough. Dip a cloth bag in hot water, dust the
inside with dry flour, put in the dough, and tie
up, leaving room for the pudding to swell. Place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">(108)</span>
in boiling water enough to cover the bag, and
boil for two hours. Serve with syrup or pudding
sauce.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Plum Pudding</i>:—One quart of flour, three-fourths
of a pound of raisins, three-fourths of
a pound of fat salt pork well washed and cut into
small pieces, two tablespoonfuls of sugar or a little
molasses. Mix in just sufficient water to wet
it well. Some think it is improved by the addition
of a tablespoonful of baking powder stirred
into the flour before mixing. Boil in a bag, as in
the case of the plain flour pudding. The pudding
will come out of the bag easier, if it is
plunged into cold water for an instant, as soon
as it is taken out of the kettle. Do not let it
set in the bag. All bag-puddings must be kept
covered with water and kept boiling violently all
the time they are on the fire. Also they must be
mixed with as little water as possible. Otherwise
they will either be soggy or will be a mush
from absorption of the water in the pot.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Fig Pudding</i>:—Cut 6 figs in pieces, cover
with cold water and let it come to a boil over a
slow fire; put into a dish and add 2 teaspoonfuls
of sugar. Beat up an egg with a pinch of
salt and a tablespoonful of sugar, one of flour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">(109)</span>
and stir it into a half pint of boiling milk. As
soon as it thickens, pour the mixture over the
figs in the dish. I have forgotten where I saw
this receipt, but I am going to appropriate it and
the author will please accept my thanks right
here, if he sees this, for it is good.</p>


<h4>DRINKS.</h4>

<p class="recipe"><i>Coffee</i>:—The finest drink for the camper is
good coffee, but there is more coffee spoiled in
making than would drown all the fraternity.
Coffee boiled is coffee spoiled. The simplest
method is to put in the can one tablespoonful of
finely ground coffee for each person to be served,
and one more for the pot. When the water is
boiling hard, turn in a cupful for each person and
one more for a possible extra. Cover tight and
set where it will keep hot and not boil, for fifteen
minutes. The grounds will settle of their
own accord. If wanted in a hurry, let it set a
few minutes and then stir with a clean stick.
This will saturate the grains more quickly, but
it is at a slight expense of aroma.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Black Coffee</i>—(Café noir): Have a percolator
or large strainer; put in one cupful of
ground coffee to each quart of water. Have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">(110)</span>
water boiling and pour it slowly through the percolator.
The surface of the water should be
just above the coffee in the strainer, when the
allowance is in the pot. Keep it hot, but do not
let it boil. A good strainer is made of a piece
of gauze sewn on to a ring of wire a little larger
than the mouth of the pot. Keep the pot covered
tightly.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Gloria</i>:—Make the same as <i lang="fr">café noir</i>.
Sweeten well and pour a little fine brandy over
the bowl of a spoon, into each cup. Set fire to
the spirit, and when half consumed blow out the
fire and drink. A good quality of brandy must
be used or it will not blaze.</p>


<p class="recipe"><i>Tea</i>:—Use a teaspoonful of tea to each cup.
Have the water boiling, and use fresh water.
Put the tea in the pot and pour the water over
it. Let it set for a few minutes, in a warm place,
to “draw.”</p>


<p class="p1">And now, in the hopes that these records of
camp experiences may save some unlucky wight,

<span class="title">SICKNESS IN CAMP</span></h2>
</div>


<p>This subject was not forgotten in the design
of this little camp companion, but the danger
from the administration of drugs by incompetent
hands is great, and the author felt that a <em>little</em>
knowledge <em>is</em> a dangerous thing, and something
that should be avoided. However, some of the
readers have expressed opinions in the matter,
and requested its insertion. In the preparation
of a new edition of the book, a good opportunity
presented itself, and a little advice is herewith
offered. The author still advises that a physician
be consulted, if it be possible, not only on
account of the danger of taking a wrong medicine
or too much of a proper one, but because
few people are really competent to make a proper
diagnosis.</p>

<p>In the list of supplies, a harmless laxative and
a convenient stimulant, both familiar to every
one, were included. In the majority of cases,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">(113)</span>
these, with plenty of hot or cold water, will suffice
for a remedy until proper medical advice can
be obtained. It is considered only common sense
that a convalescent or semi-invalid would come
provided with remedies furnished by his medical
adviser; but it is the unexpected that confronts
us, and it is hoped that the same common sense
may be used in such cases.</p>

<p>Illness in camp is generally due to one of three
causes: <i>injuries</i>, <i>disturbances</i> of the <i>digestive</i>
functions, or <i>exposure</i>. In the first case, accidents
are generally due to carelessness, and perhaps
in the other cases the same fact may be
true; so, perhaps, the advice to observe proper
precautions and <span class="allsmcap">KEEP WELL</span>, may be thoroughly
applicable.</p>

<p>Dislocations and broken bones are the province
of the surgeon; but if the reader thinks he
will ever need the knowledge, “First Aid to the
Injured” is easily acquired before leaving for
camp.</p>

<p>Simple cuts sometimes become inflamed, and
should, then, be kept wet with cold water bandages.
If a disinfectant is needed, Seiler’s Antiseptic
Tablets are preferable to either Carbolic
Acid or Corrosive Sublimate, both of which are
exceedingly dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">(114)</span></p>

<p>Burns and scalds should be bandaged and kept
wet with cold water. A poultice of scraped raw
potato will relieve inflammation. Sprinkle flour
over the surface of the wound. Especially remember
that it is needful to keep the air from
the inflamed surface, therefore do not remove
the bandages often. For Sunburn, apply linseed
oil and limewater (Carron-oil). Bruises
and sprains should be treated with hot water,
applied with a cloth as hot as can be borne. I
have used Haynes’ Arabian Balsam for many
years and it has seldom failed. It works more
quickly than the hot water and is more convenient
when on a tramp.</p>

<p>Blistered feet are a nuisance and may generally
be avoided by using proper foot-wear and
ordinary attention to cleanliness. If a blister
come, prick it, wash with hot water and cover
with a tallowed cloth. Rub the inside of the
sock with dry soap.</p>

<p>For choking, a sharp blow between the shoulders
will usually dislodge the obstruction. If a
fishbone lodges, which cannot be reached, swallow
a bit of dry bread. A gargle of vinegar is
said to soften a fishbone, but I have never tried
it.</p>

<p>Stings and bites of insects are more troublesome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">(115)</span>
than dangerous, and the irritation will
generally be alleviated by salt and water. Pennyroyal
leaves will allay irritation and also keep
away the pests.</p>

<p>Ivy or dogwood poison will generally yield to
any astringent wash like soda or ashes. An infusion
of the leaves and twigs of the <i>Spicebush</i>,
when it can be obtained, will cure the worst case.
For inflamed eyes, use hot water bandages.</p>

<p>Nosebleed can generally be stopped by dashing
cold water on the back of the neck. If serious,
plug the nostrils to form a clot; but see that the
blood does not run down the throat to cause
suffocation. If the case is obstinate, put the feet
in a pail of <em>warm</em> water and add <em>hot</em> water to
it until it is unbearable.</p>

<p>Among the digestive troubles, disturbance of
the bowels due to change of water and diet is
the most common. In the case of constipation,
a good dose of physic, followed by plenty of
fresh water, will generally suffice. For this purpose
a dose of Salts is as good as anything. Or
mix a teaspoonful of Cream of Tartar with as
much sugar, put in a glass of water, stir it well
and drink. If taken before breakfast or on an
empty stomach, relief will ensue in a short time.
If the bowels are loose, a dose of Rhubarb will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">(116)</span>
generally suffice as well as for the contrary condition.
The principal point to be gained in any
case of bowel disturbance is to clear the tract
of any fermenting matter. If a diarrhœa becomes
troublesome, make an infusion of blackberry
vines and roots. I have found the running
variety best. But be very careful not to
check too quickly or a worse condition may be
induced.</p>

<p>Occasionally a case of ptomaine poisoning appears,
which may be caused by canned goods, especially
if you are not careful to empty the can
at once. Clear the bowels thoroughly and feed
on milk and eggs for a day. If the patient does
not recover at once, consult a doctor.</p>

<p>Headache is generally due to a disordered
stomach, but may be induced by a cold or by
getting over-heated. In the first case a dose of
physic, and a good night’s sleep, will effect a
cure; the ordinary treatment for a cold will fix
the second; and in the last case, pack the head
in ice or very cold water. If the patient gets
stupid and breathless, take him into the shade,
strip the upper body, douche the head with
cold water and fan vigorously to induce respiration.</p>

<p>Heartburn (so called) is a common result of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">(117)</span>
too much fatty food, and the handiest remedy is
to pound up a little charcoal, mix with water
and drink. Another troublesome result of a disordered
stomach is the eruption known as Hives.
Wash with saleratus and water, and take Cream
of Tartar as directed in a former paragraph. Do
not put on any greasy salve.</p>

<p>Exposure or carelessness in changing the
clothing often results in what is commonly called
a “cold.” A few hot drinks and a night under
warm blankets will usually bring relief; but if
it get troublesome, drink plenty of hot water or
tea, wrap in blankets and sweat it out. If the
stomach revolts at the hot water, make an infusion
of the leaves and twigs of the snapwood
(<i lang="la">Benzoin odoriferum</i>) or of checkerberry leaves
(<i lang="la">Gaultheria procumbens</i>). When the disturbance
is seated in the bowels, it often results in a
colic, for which there is nothing better than
black-pepper tea. Pour hot water over a teaspoonful
of pepper to make a large cupful and
drink as hot as possible. The remedy is nearly
as bad as the disease, but not as fatal.</p>

<p>Neuralgia may generally be eased by cloths
wrung out in hot water and applied to the affected
part. If in a tooth that is decayed, a hot
raisin will often soothe the pain. In earache<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">(118)</span>
apply a roasted onion as hot as can be borne.
I cannot recommend <em>any</em> of the popular headache
remedies. They should never be used except
by a physician, and even in that case are
often dangerous. I shall not explain this as it
may be considered libel by the doctor.</p>

<p>If there is sore throat, a cold water bandage
will generally relieve it by the next morning.
For an aggravating cough an infusion of Mullein
leaves (<i lang="la">Verbascum</i>) drunk freely will afford
relief. Nothing is really necessary except to
allay irritation and hot water slowly sipped will
often be sufficient.</p>

<p>A combination of exposure, indigestion and
fatigue, that often comes to the camper, sometimes
results in an inflammation of the pleura,
indicated by an excruciating pain in the side.
This may be allayed by a mustard plaster. Watch
that it does not blister; for in camp that may
prove very serious.</p>

<p>Muscular cramps generally affect the legs,
and in this case, get the feet warm, rub the part
affected briskly, and straighten out the toes, forcibly
if necessary. Hot stones wrapped in cloth
or even cloths wrung out in hot water will serve
to warm the feet.</p>

<p>If a medicine case is considered necessary, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">(119)</span>
box containing the following materials is suggested,
in addition to the remedies mentioned on
page 15.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cream-of-Tartar.</li>
<li>Carron-oil (Linseed oil and Limewater).</li>
<li>A small vial of <span class="cor" title="Source: 1-8" id="cor119">1/8</span> grain Morphine pills.</li>
<li>Package of Seiler’s Antiseptic Tablets.</li>
<li>Roll of bandages.</li>
</ul>

<p>I cannot recommend Carbolic Acid nor Corrosive
Sublimate as antiseptics. The tablets are
better and perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Above all, mix all remedies with common
sense. If you carry drugs, be sure to know their
action before you start from home.</p>

<p>The suggestion was made that I give instructions
for the use of Nature’s Remedies as found
in the herbs and bushes, which would be very
<i lang="fr">apropos</i> if it were not for the fact that it would
require a special botanical knowledge, instruction
in which has no place here, and more time
would be required in preparation than can usually
be spared in camp. As well, an amount of
space which the publisher would probably hesitate
to provide. A few of them, however, are
very useful and generally easily obtained. If a
person has the necessary botanical knowledge, a
remedy for any illness could, I have no doubt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">(120)</span>
be readily obtained near at hand in almost any
camp; and if the reader wishes to charge his
mind with the subject, the following list, with
the aid of a little previous study, may be valuable.</p>

<p>Ginger-bush; spice-bush (<i lang="la">Benzoin odoriferum</i>)
will break up a cold, relieve the irritation
of ivy or <span class="cor" title="Source: dogwool" id="cor120">dogwood</span> poison, and incidentally
cure the worst case of erysipelas. Steep the
leaves and twigs in water and apply internally,
externally and eternally.</p>

<p>Checkerberry; boxberry; teaberry (<i lang="la">Gaultheria
procumbens</i>) will make a pleasant drink
that will help break up a cold or cure indigestion.
It is a fact, however, that almost any
aromatic herb, (not poisonous), will make a
good <i>tea</i>, the principal effect being due to the
hot water.</p>

<p>Climbing wax-work root (<i lang="la">Celastrus scandens</i>)
seethed in lard, will make a salve that will
prove almost magical in case of burns either of
fire or sun.</p>

<p>Bayberry root (<i lang="la">Myrica cerifera</i>) or Barberry
bark (<i lang="la">Berberis vulgaris</i>) makes a good gargle
for sore mouth or a wash for inflamed eyes. Do
not be alarmed if you swallow a little of the
infusion, it will do you good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">(121)</span></p>

<p>Blackberry root (<i lang="la">Rubus Villosus</i>) is valuable
for bowel complaints.</p>

<p>Boneset or thoroughwort (<i lang="la">Eupatorium</i>) cures
a cold; but be careful not to use too freely.</p>

<p>Dandelion root (<i lang="la">Taraxacum dens-leonis</i>)
stimulates the appetite and aids digestion.</p>

<p>High-bush Cranberry bark; Cramp-wood
(<i lang="la">Viburnum opulus</i>) is used for cramps in the
stomach and bowels.</p>

<p>Mullein (<i lang="la">Verbascum thapsus</i>) allays an aggravating
cough.</p>

<p>Partridge-berry vines (<i lang="la">Mitchella repens</i>) relieves
retention of the urine.</p>

<p>Pennyroyal (<i lang="la">Hedeoma pulegioides</i>) is a remedy
for the stomach-ache or wind in the bowels.</p>

<p>Yarrow (<i lang="la">Achillea millefolium</i>) or Prickly-ash
berries (<i lang="la">Xanthoxylum</i>) is a remedy for ague.</p>

<p>Of the common household materials, pepper-tea
is a convenient irritant for bowel trouble.
Mustard poultice is too well known to need comment.
A roasted onion is a good poultice for
a boil or abscess, and a poultice of tobacco
leaves, generally common in any camp, will
serve to apply to boils, stings, poisonous bites,
<abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr> Use this latter carefully for it is a powerful
poison, and the external application may
produce an unpleasant result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">(122)</span></p>

<p>The preparation of these remedies is usually
by infusion, which should be prepared from a
handful of the leaves, bark or roots, placed in
a dish and about a pint of boiling water turned
over it, allowed to stand in a warm place to
simmer for a time and drank warm generally.</p>

<p>Sweet Fern (<i lang="la">Comptonia asplenifolia</i>); Wild
Cherry (<i lang="la">Prunus Virginiana</i>) bark or fruit;
Hardhack or Steeple-bush (<i lang="la">Spiraea tomentosa</i>);
or Mountain Cranberry (<i lang="la">Arctostaphylos
uva-ursi</i>) are all remedies for diarrhœa which
may be used on occasion. Nearly any astringent
is useful in this case, but should be used only
when the case refuses to yield to the action of
a cathartic.</p>

<p>Poplar bark (<i lang="la">Populus tremuloides</i>); Spearmint
(<i lang="la">Mentha viridis</i>) or almost any kind of
mint which may be found in the nearest low
land; or Button-bush (<i lang="la">Cephalanthus occidentalis</i>)
will serve as a febrifuge in case of a severe
cold from exposure.</p>

<p>Gold-thread (<i lang="la">Coptis trifolia</i>) which is usually
common in swamps: or Oak bark (<i lang="la">Quercus sp.</i>)
are valuable in checking the canker or sore
mouth which often comes after a diet of salt
meats.</p>

<p>Witch Hazel (<i lang="la">Hamamelis virginica</i>) is a common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">(123)</span>
remedy for irritated skin and many other
ills, but I have never seen that it did much good
other than to lubricate the surface.</p>

<p>Sweet-flag root (<i lang="la">Acorus calamus</i>) relieves the
pressure of wind in the stomach and bowels, due
generally to fermentation. This is a disagreeable
condition and I have known obstinate cases to
be cured by nibbling a bit of the root occasionally.</p>

<p>Labrador tea (<i lang="la">Ledum latifolium</i>) when the
camper is far enough north to find it, makes a
pleasant drink and is preferable to coffee or
“store” tea. It is tonic and pectoral, giving the
habitual user a sensation of comfort and cleanliness
of the system.</p>
